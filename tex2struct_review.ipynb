       " \"Reviewed Nov. 30, 2021\\nI first registered for a Model X in December 2020 at a Tesla dealership. I was told that the car would be available in February 2021. After that the communication went completely downhill. February came and went, zero communication. Some time later the date on my Tesla account was updated to August 21.... That came and went. It's almost December 2021 and we still don't have a car. No one at the dealership has a clue as to when the car will be available. The communication from Tesla has been minimal to none. Yes, Auto dealers across the US have had supply chain issues. But communication from other luxury car companies has been leaps and bounds better than Tesla. I hope Tesla management is getting this feedback. EVs are going to have some serious competition.... And based on Tesla's approach towards customer service (or lack thereof), I am now inclined to wait and purchase an EV from a competitor.\",\n",

My only injuries are minor - bruised hands from the impact of the airbags. Even the insurance adjustor commented on how the impact must have been tremendous.

       " \"FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AND A FAILURE TO UPHOLD THE PROMISED CAPABILITIES OF THE VEHICLEI am writing to file a formal complaint against Tesla, regarding a significant issue with my Tesla Model Y 2021, which I purchased inDecember last year. This matter pertains to false advertising and a failure to uphold the promised capabilities of the vehicle. DespiteTesla's advertising and product descriptions promising a range of 330 miles on a full charge, my car has consistently achieved at least40% less than this advertised range. This drastic shortfall has severely impacted the vehicle's usability and the value I derive from it. Ischeduled a service appointment with Tesla. The resolution proposed by the service team was both shocking and unacceptable. Theysuggested that to achieve the advertised range, I would need to disable the vehicle's cameras. This advice is not only impractical but alsonegates one of the key safety features of the car. There was no disclosure at the point of sale that the use of standard vehicle features,such as the cameras, would so drastically reduce the car's range. To suggest disabling a critical feature to achieve the advertisedperformance is misleading and diminishes the value and functionality of the vehicle. Feeling deceived by Tesla, as the product delivereddoes not meet the specifications and capabilities that were advertised, I am seeking a resolution to this matter. I propose the followingoptions: 1-A technical fix to the car that allows it to achieve the advertised 330-mile range without disabling any safety or standardfeatures. 2-Complimentary access to Tesla's Supercharger network 3-A full refund for the vehicle, allowing me to return the car.Date of experience: February 14, 2024\",\n",
