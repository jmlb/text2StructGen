We put a deposit down back in December 2021 for a model Y. It is now end of October and still no vehicle. We keep getting bumped later and later to time windows (now for November 2022). We cannot wait any longer and when I called to request a deposit refund, they say there are no exceptions!!! It's insane. I spoke to 4 reps and a manager and there is no budging on their policy. So I am out a deposit because Tesla didn't deliver anywhere close to their original time estimate. Our estimate was May by the way. I'm shocked that Tesla would rather lose my future business and image of them over $250 deposit. I will not consider a vehicle or speak highly to anyone I know. I think we dodged a bullet though because if this is how they handle situations before I even get the car, I can't imagine how it would be when I have a future issue. The reps didn't apologize whatsoever for the long wait and it disregarded any of my points. Very disappointed!","{'date_of_review': 'Oct. 26, 2022', 'vehicle_model': 'model Y', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'We put a deposit down back in December 2021 for a model Y.

I ordered a model 3 SR+ from Tesla's existing new inventory, hoping to take delivery before the end of the year. The car had 2100 miles on it which I could see on the website and had an appropriate discount for the mileage. The car arrived and the salesman contacted me to let me know the car was in but also wanted to make sure I knew the car has some miles on it. I said yes, and asked to make sure everything else was fine. He says ""let me check."" He got back to me later that day to let me know that the wheels have some damage on them. I asked if that would be fixed before I take delivery and he tells me no.

Horrible customer service, vehicle quality, roadside assistance response. My Model 3 is 3 months old and it just died… with 100% battery charge. I could not open the car to get my wallet out of it… what if it had been my kid stuck inside? I could not get a hold of an actual human to speak with, only could communicate on their own time through text or the app. Finally, my car was towed 100 miles from my home. No one called me, no mention of a rental. No response in the app. I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.","{'date_of_review': '2022-08-15', 'vehicle_model': 'Model 3', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Horrible customer service, vehicle quality, roadside assistance response.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['The car died with 100% battery charge'], 'other_issues': ['Poor communication', 'No one called me', 'No mention of a rental', 'No response in the app'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

I bought my 2013 Model S from its 2nd owner at 98k miles after lots of research reaffirming that maintenance cost was low and reliability was high. I actually loved my car, drove smoothly and quietly, but then I didn’t even reached 120k miles on it when the high voltage battery completely died on me. I parked one day at work with 80% charge and got out from work to find the battery completely drained to the point of not even starting or being able to put into neutral to push it to a charging stall. I left the car plugged in using 3 extension cords for the entire weekend (still at my job’s parking lot) and it didn’t take any charge at all and never turned back on again. I towed it to the nearest Tesla service center and after over a week they told me the battery had completely died and it needed full replacement to the tune of $23k (the car’s average value in the best condition possible and long range trim is ~$26k).

I love our 2023 Model 3, best car I have ever owned, with one exception: My 2017 Mazda 6 and my former Hyundai 2018 Sonata had something that Tesla lacks and has promised for years. THERE IS NO REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT SYSTEM! Despite 10 cameras on all sides and inside the cabin, I cannot rely on a system of alerts for this purpose that I have had on my 7 or 8 year old vehicles and Elon Musk I understand promised several years ago, despite the great ability to send out regular software updates!

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=9,"Think 10 times before buying a TeslaI bought my first Tesla, a supposedly “Tesla Certified Pre-Owned” Model 3, 2021, from the Glasgow branch on 13 March 2024. The person who delivered the car handed over the card keys, showed the extra mats and left. The car wasn’t cleaned properly too. That was awkward, but I also thought it was Tesla’s procedure. However, three days later, everything started to reveal.1) The camera calibration had been recently reset before the delivery. This was presumably done with the knowledge that there were issues with the vehicle, as immediately after the calibration, the safety and autopilot features became unavailable due to defective cameras.2)The left camera was becoming wholly black3)The rear camera was blurry, and there were numerous scratches on the lens.4) Even though the cameras, autopilot, and cruise control features were working occasionally, the car was making dangerous manoeuvres, thereby putting lives in danger.5) The condensation on headlights, rear lights and cameras was significant. (I was informed that the condensation coverage under warranty would not be applied unless it exceeded 50%. This conclusion was reached without physically examining the vehicle, based solely on the photographs provided via service request.)6) After being able to drive the car on the motorway, I realised there was deficient air and soundproofing from the windows. When I checked the windows closer the rubbers on two windows were not fitted.7) Last but not least, I discovered the ugliest truth when I became familiar with the car. There was a phone (also remotely via app), and two more card keys (probably previous owner) had full access to my car all along.None of the conditions were disclosed at the point of sale. I had to drive to Europe on 17 March 2024, which was a long before-planned business and leisure trip. Starting 16 March 2024, including phone calls and visiting the Tesla Centre, Glasgow, UK, the Tesla Centre, Edinburgh, UK and the Tesla Service Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands, service request chat with Tesla Service Centre, Freiburg, Germany, and via e-mail to Tesla UK, Tesla US and Tesla NL. I couldn’t get any kind of response other than the service request I started. I was rejected to get a service from Tesla Service Centres in Amsterdam, Netherlands and Freiburg, Germany, even though the car was supposed to be under warranty. After days of conversation via service request, I was able to reach out to make a service appointment with the Glasgow Tesla Centre on 3 April 2024. I prepared a document telling of the issues, not being able to contact anyone and any department from Tesla Corporation except the service request. I explicitly requested to return the car and refund as these are significant safety issues. The branch supervisor in Glasgow Tesla Centre admittedly accepted that there was a huge issue and the car shouldn’t have been delivered like that in the first place. However, first, they told me that they could not apply the ‘14-day Return Policy’ (as I could have the chance to come from Europe and they were open during the Easter Holiday) and that the issue could be evaluated under the ‘30-day Rejection’. Then, they agreed to apply a ‘14-day Return Policy’ as this case was exceptional. However, they also wanted to make a deduction for mileage, which I explicitly refused as I have done everything in my power not to escalate this issue to this point. So, on 3 April 2024, I filled out the forms and left the car in the Glasgow Tesla centre. Today, 11 April 2024, I haven’t received any e-mails from Tesla Corporation. More importantly, I am still waiting for the refund. I am not able to buy another car and am still paying more for the rental cars. All in all, think at least ten times before buying a Tesla. You will not find anyone to contact to resolve an issue, and you will be expected to cover everything they caused.Date of experience: March 16, 2024","{'date_of_review': '2024-03-16', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model 3', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': ""Bought a supposedly 'Tesla Certified Pre-Owned' Model 3, but it had numerous issues including camera calibration reset, defective cameras, condensation on headlights and cameras, deficient air and soundproofing from the windows, and unauthorized access to the car."", 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Camera calibration had been recently reset', 'Left camera was becoming wholly black', 'Rear camera was blurry with numerous scratches on the lens', 'Car was making dangerous manoeuvres, putting lives in danger', 'Condensation on headlights, rear lights and cameras'], 'other_issues': ['Deficient air and soundproofing from the windows', 'Unauthorized access to the car via phone and card keys'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

I am highly susceptible to motion sickness. Within 15 minutes of being in the car, whether I was driving or a passenger in the front seat, I felt sick. This is due to the one pedal driving. The constant need for micro adjustments in pressure on the right pedal to maintain a steady speed is the reason. We were really excited to buy a Tesla. We cannot buy one now. We will never buy a car that does not allow us to turn off the OPD. Turning it down to a lower setting is not enough. I really hope that this the philosophy Tesla is embracing of OPD completely does not overtake the EV industry. We need an EV where I can turn off the OPD and use regenerative braking through pressure on the brake pedal. My limited Internet research shows that it is difficult to find a ev where you can turn off the OPD completely. This is very frustrating.","{'date_of_review': '2023-10-22', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'I am highly susceptible to motion sickness due to the one pedal driving.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['constant need for micro adjustments in pressure on the right pedal'], 'other_issues': [""can't buy a Tesla because of OPD"", 'difficult to find an EV where you can turn off the OPD completely'], 'service_experience': '', 'overall_experience': ''}",True

Bought this Tesla Y Model. On 3rd day, battery died, Tesla said it's not covered, asked for $1,500 to fix battery and coil. This is on the 3rd day of driving the car. If the battery isn't covered on a Tesla, what is covered? Their customer service is a bunch of morons who talk to you like machines. Their customer service skills are the worst we've ever experienced. Stay away from Tesla, the car is not worth it. Wait for a reputable company like Mercedes, BMW, Ford or Toyota and buy their electric vehicle. Tesla is a piece of crap in every sense of the word. Don't fall for the hype or the stock increase. It's a disastrous product to say the least.","{'date_of_review': '2021-12-24', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Y Model', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': ""This is a terrible experience with Tesla's customer service and the car itself."", 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['battery died'], 'other_issues': ['poor customer service', 'uncovered battery issue'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

The technician looked at it and went inside the service center and came back after a few minutes. After coming back he said that he spoke with the technicians inside that worked on my car and they said that there is no accident inside and it should be an existing scratch, and he said that Tesla is not responsible for existing scratches.

It's sad, but this car is a very expensive piece of garbage. When it was sold to us many promises were made regarding updates to come and features to be added via Over the Air updates. They haven't come. The updates they have made, have made the car far worse and despite multiple calls to customer support, they refuse to remove distracting and dangerous features. The car is supposed to get 260 miles per charge, but only gets 1/2 of that on a good week. We took it in for service and were told it was functioning normally.

Purchased a model x a year ago and still can’t get it registered.The DMV asked me to provide proof of taxes paid which I relayed to sales person. After countless emails to the sales person and delivery team they finally respond with, ""We are not supplying you with any more documents!"" Lender is not happy and I have a car that can’t be registered. I’ve got to say, perhaps they should spend more energy on how to provide better service. If I were Elon I would be embarrassed but I guess as long as they make Wallstreet happy birthday who cares about the people they shaft. Look elsewhere for electric vehicles that actually can provide support and service after the sale.","{'date_of_review': '2021-12-09', 'vehicle_model': 'model x', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'Purchased a model x a year ago and still can’t get it registered.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': [""can't get it registered""], 'other_issues': ['DMV asked me to provide proof of taxes paid', 'Lender is not happy'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

Clean, well thought out interior and controls. Over-the-air-updates mean my car gets free upgrades with new features for free. No other car company does this. 5* crash rating across the board. I want my family in the safest car on the road and this is it. No more gas. Not having to fill up at the station anymore is freeing. I have driven this from DC to Maine and back, Florida and back, and Kansas and back. I didn’t have to switch drivers because it was less fatiguing with autopilot/FSD beta as an assistant. Definitely much safer experience since it was much less tiring and so I was more alert at the end of the drive.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=7,"Tesla’s Cutting-Edge Cars, Archaic Customer Service:I can’t stress enough how disappointing my service experience has been with Tesla on multiple occasions now. First, it was the charging issue. I spent around two months going back and forth, trying to convince Tesla that there was a problem with my car’s charging compatibility. During this period, my third-party service provider not only replaced my charger three times but also offered me discounts on my charges, which is far more than Tesla ever did.And now, I find myself in another long-winded ordeal. I’ve waited 35 days for an appointment to fix a non-opening passenger door, only to be told that the necessary parts are unavailable. It’s mind-boggling how a company that prides itself on being cutting-edge can be so archaic when it comes to customer service. I’m not dealing with a minor inconvenience here; I can’t even open my passenger door!I’m starting to question Tesla’s credibility and commitment to customer satisfaction. These aren’t isolated incidents but a recurring pattern of poor service and lack of accountability. It’s completely unacceptableDate of experience: August 30, 2023","{'date_of_review': '2023-08-30', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 'terrible', 'review_summary': 'I can’t stress enough how disappointing my service experience has been with Tesla on multiple occasions now.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['charging issue', 'non-opening passenger door'], 'other_issues': ['long-winded ordeal', 'unavailable parts'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

In July 2022, my model X was still under Tesla warranty. I scheduled a service visit for rattling noise. After one week at the service center, they dismissed it as being a bad tire. After six months, 3 tires, one rim, 2 alignments and a tire blowout over Christmas break 410 miles from home, It was clear there is more to it. I, again, scheduled a service with Tesla. However, now the car is no longer under warranty. In less than 6 hours, the list and estimate for the repair was sent to me. It was $5000. The manager would not even meet with me to discuss. I have no faith in such company. I intend to sell my Tesla and never deal with them again.","{'date_of_review': '2023-01-17', 'vehicle_model': 'model X', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Scheduled a service visit for rattling noise, but it was dismissed as being a bad tire.

I had a cracked windshield less than 24 hours after taking delivery of the vehicle. Then I schedule an appointment to have the windshield replaced (at my expense) and the first available date is 10 days out. On the repair day (today), the technician shows up more than one hour late (outside the 7 am-noon service window).

From the purchase experience through to the first year of owning the car, Tesla has exceeded my expectations over and over again. Favorite things so far.. Ordered the car exactly as we wanted it from the website without having to deal with high pressure upselling from a dealership. The driving experience is out of this world. You really have to experience it for yourself to believe it. It's like a spaceship. Exhilarating! Charging at home overnight once every 3 or 4 days is so much better than filling up at a gas station. Mobile service is amazing!

My late 2022 Model Y is the best car I have ever purchased or driven. The experience to purchase was literally the easiest and completely changed my desire to ever step foot into a dealership again. The car is comfortable and the sound system is the best I have ever heard. This car is all about making the experience fun for the driver and passengers. It is faster than anything I have driven and cheaper to fill up than anything I have driven. Many other benefits over gas cars, such as waking up with a charge ready to take on most days, and for road trips the Tesla charger network is ubiquitous and second to none.

Placed an order for a Model Y off what Tesla rep explained the deal would be. The day before taking delivery got a text and none of the numbers matched up. Tried to call multiple times to get this addressed. Was on hold multiple times for 30min or more. Did finally get the chance to talk to someone who couldn’t help and said I would get a callback… Call never came through. Had to cancel the order due to no contact. Tesla still charged me the $250 order fee! When I called to address this I got the same runaround. Finally was able to speak to a Customer Service representative and was told there is nothing they will do.","{'date_of_review': '2023-01-31', 'vehicle_model': 'Model Y', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Placed an order for a Model Y off what Tesla rep explained the deal would be.

I’m a 2015 Model S owner. I have to say that ever since the Model 3 came out the Customer Service has gone from Great to Terrible! I used to have a “Personal Advisor” when I dropped off my Model S for service prior to the new-and-unimproved Tesla Service. I could call that human’s mobile phone (who worked at the Service Center) before, during and after my Service. Now, as others have described, it’s nearly to talk to a human unless you drive to your Service Center and stand in line to talk to them.

Bought a Tesla Model 3 Performance in the fall of 2018. Love at first sight and drive. Smooth, quiet, quick, nimble and comfortable. Great visibility. The tech is superior to any other car. The display screen is well-designed and provides information, feedback and warnings at a glance. Traveling is incredibly easy with its navigation system. Charging is effortless. The majority of our charging is using a regular wall outlet at home. When traveling the Tesla Supercharger network is everywhere. It has been 100% flawless.

I bought a new Tesla Y LR in September of 2023. As of this writing I have 10,500 miles on it. I was already aware that the actual range will differ from the stated range based on speed and weather. The majority of my driving is within 100 mile range so charging at home is inexpensive and convenient. It is a well built car that fun to drive. 2023 saw a refresh of the Y with better suspension and noise reduction.

I did it! I traded my 2001 Toyota Corolla for a 2O24 Tesla Y! The drivability is off the chart! It’s a one pedal driving. You don’t use the brake! When you lift off the accelerator it starts slowing the car down to a complete stop at a stoplight. The Torque is off this chart. You don’t know what real Torque is until you drive a Tesla. It makes driving way easier. I’m a person who is not good with driving cars that I'm not familiar with. When I drove this car it was a natural fit for me. This car is very intuitive and user friendly! Tesla made it really easy to buy through the app. I also purchased Tesla insurance. It's way cheaper.

We bought our model x in 2016. As soon as the warranty was up in 2019 the car seemed to fall apart. The backseat winged doors stopped shutting properly and I was told there was no fix, that the doors sometimes didn’t close properly in hot weather!!! Then the door handle on the driver’s side door started malfunctioning and when you press the handle it takes about 30 seconds for the door to open. I was told this was a $800 fix. Then the driver's side window stopped working and would get stuck down. I had this repaired for $300 and since then have had Tesla back 4 times to repair the same problem. The latest issue has been with the air conditioner in the car. If the temp outside reaches 95 or above the ac only blows hot air. I took it in to be repaired and found out I need a new compressor for $1,400. So I would think twice about this purchase.","{'date_of_review': '2021-07-21', 'vehicle_model': 'model x', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'As soon as the warranty was up in 2019 the car seemed to fall apart.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['backseat winged doors stopped shutting properly', ""driver's side door started malfunctioning and takes about 30 seconds for the door to open"", ""driver's side window stopped working and would get stuck down"", 'air conditioner in the car only blows hot air when temp outside reaches 95 or above'], 'other_issues': [], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

To whom it may concern: This started when I had a car accident and I lost total destruction of my car and a friend of mine told me, try out the Tesla, that it's a good car, I rent it for 10 days and I liked it, so I bought the home charger and installed it first before buying the car, because I knew I was going to buy the Tesla. I received an email on June 20, from a Tesla advisor (Rachel **), offering a promotion that was extended until June 30, 2024, where they offer the new model 3 Long Range AWD car, enjoy the $7500 federal credit incentive and the option of 2.99% APR for 48-60 months (attached copy of the original email) without just thinking about making the purchase online. On June 21 I made the reservation and paid $250. Fill out all the forms and I was approved quickly. On the financial side I see that the APR was 6.14% and not the 2.99% they had offered.

Not a fun experience buying a Tesla in Vancouver, B.C. We were driving to the ferry after a chaotic pick up of a model Y. My wife found the seat uncomfortable for her lower back and started searching for the lumbar control to adjust. Guess what? No lumbar control on the passenger side. Apparently, Tesla tweeted out their decision to discontinue the lumbar support on the passenger side. Gee, shame on us for not having a Twitter account and following Tesla. The official tutorial on the Tesla website shows this feature on the passenger side and how to adjust it. Silly us for thinking it was true.

Tesla Service is absolutely awful. It has taken two months to get control arms replaced. They replaced windshield and now it leaks. They want to charge me for a second one because they say they don't warranty windshields. No joke. First you schedule a service issue. Then they schedule you three weeks out and diagnose the problem. Then they schedule you to come back in another 4 weeks to have the problem repaired. All the while they send you snarky text responses to your questions and tell you how all of this is your fault. They all need service at some point. I don't see this getting better any time soon. This was also the second time this happened. The first time was for severe shaking during acceleration. Same awful experience. Takes weeks to fix and you have to deal with snarky, condescending text messages on the app. BOTTOM LINE: DONT BUY A TESLA.","{'date_of_review': 'Oct. 18, 2022', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 'terrible', 'review_summary': 'Tesla Service is absolutely awful.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['control arms replaced', 'windshield leaks'], 'other_issues': ['snarky text responses', 'condescending text messages on the app'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=9,"Really good car, woeful customer serviceHad the car for three and a half years from new, servicing/repairs are always the frustrating issue. You have to book through the app, where it's triaged and with messages back and forth this can add a week before you can even book a time slot. The usual wait for us is about a week after that.The actual service engineers are really pleasant and competent, but there's this triage layer that sits between that communicates only via ""messages in the app"", faceless and often heartless ""thankyou for your understanding"" is the de facto signature when they push your appointment out or cancel something.Our most recent issue is the car stopped kicking out any heat from the HVAC, in winter in England. We've just been delayed another week, as the parts have no ETA and they are just pushing us back week at a time. It's been 4 weeks currently.The car doesn't heat at all, and if the HVAC is turned on it pump out ice cold air. It won't defog, it wont clear windscreen and my 6 year old kid has endured three weeks of being driven to school in around 0 degree temperatures. It's borderline dangerous as it does fog up quickly and you can't clear it when driving. This doesn't seem to concern tesla, or do anything to change your place in the parts bin queue.There's a side issue where some of the water proof lining under the car has come off, and even though it's no fault of ours, that's not a warranty issue and they are happy to bill us £180 for what could easily be classed as poor trim fittings, or should be done complementary to apologize for having to endure a winter in England with no heating or defogging in the car.I can't use the car for work as I work 2 hours drive away and I would either have to drive with the windows partially down and in a coat and gloves. We are a one car family, so having to wait 4-6 weeks for parts is kind of crippling.I have the performance model and love the car to bits. It's just such a shame their customer service is so utterly and unashamedly awful, and what's worse is there's no visible plan to correct this. We've seen this over 3.5 years, and it's definitely got worse that over this time, despite what they might counter.Was thinking of going Tesla Solar, and Power Walls for home but this is the final straw. If we ever had an issue with that, the customer service would be of the same model so to heck with that.Concerningly in the UK the current thing is to try and adopt a tesla style hands off approach to customer service, but that would be great if it worked. It doesn't, so strap yourself in for a bumpy ride.Car is good (Model 3 performance), has it's faults and is by no means perfect, but is seriously undone by customer service designed by millennials.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=16,"Customer Service is Appalling - No common senseThis rating is not essentially for the car itself but rather the behaviour, set up and sheer incompetence of Tesla UK staff. I paid £48,440 for a new Model 3. It's not Merc or BMW quality, but more like a Mondeo standard (the plastic plates on the front door frames came off after a few days as they hadn't been glued down properly). They won't deliver it to your nearest Tesla dealer and expect you to travel the country to pick it up. I was asked if I would travel 200 miles (which I pointed out was against the law due to lockdown rules).  The car itself though is a dream to drive and a credit to Elon Musk. Now the real gripe. I was offered 1 years free supercharging but got charged when I used it on 31st Dec so I queried this with the salesman. He told me that the system was that I would be contacted later in January when the benefit went 'live' and not to worry, as I would get 1 year from then. I didn't use the superchargers deliberately and charged only from home in anticipation of this communication. 7 weeks later in late Feb, I realised I still hadn't been contacted and so called the salesman and reminded him of the conversation. He said he would look into it and get back 'by the end of the week'. Which he didn't. So I had to chase him again. After some email exchange where he apologised for 'mis-communication' he told me that the years benefit had in fact started on 1st Jan. As this was their mix up and misinformation to me, I requested that I should simply be given the free year from that date (17th Feb). This was refused and I was told it was 'not possible' (Elon Musk put a car in orbit in the asteroid belt, but changing the years supercharging date is apparently an impossibility). This isn't a large amount of money but the sheer arrogance of the company in creating a problem for their customer and expecting the customer to pay for it gives me a really bad 'feel' about this company. They have the arrogance of BMW/Merc/Audi salesmen of the 1980's when high flying executives were queuing up for their quality company cars.

I have paint issues and interior problems. For instance, there is a small dent on my hood that I have called several times with no return calls. My steering wheel cover is coming apart and I schedule an appointment. A guy by the name of Jeff called me back and asked for a picture. I sent the picture and he sent me a note back that he was canceling the appointment because the steering wheel is not under warranty. No options just that it's not covered.

I’ve been driving the Tesla Model X Plaid for a few months now and I’m absolutely thrilled with it. It’s the most amazing car I’ve ever owned. It has everything I need in a family car: space, comfort, safety, and performance. The Falcon doors are not only cool but also practical, making it easy to get in and out of the car even in tight parking spaces. The interior is spacious and minimalist, with a huge touchscreen that controls everything from navigation to entertainment. The build quality is excellent and the materials are premium. The driving range is impressive, with up to 333 miles on a single charge. And the performance is mind-blowing, with a staggering 1020 horsepower and a 0-60 mph time of 2.5 seconds. It’s like having a supercar and an SUV in one. The Model X is not cheap, but it’s worth every penny. It’s the future of motoring and I love it.","{'date_of_review': '2023-05-24', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model X Plaid', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': ""I'm absolutely thrilled with the car.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=18,"I know you seeAbysmal service with a little bait and switch on the side the 1 star and the title…I know you see the 1 star and the title but I want to start off this post by saying I love Tesla cars. I have had a Model S since 2015 and I love hearing about Tesla’s success. When the solar panel price dropped in July 2020 I jumped on the bandwagon happy to support Tesla again. I called family and friends to recommend them adding solar as well. I regret that now and will be telling everyone I can about the worst experience I have had will a company in over a decade…they need to work on their solar side. 1)	The initial process was wonderful and even installation was a positive experience. Those installing the panels were great, courteous and knowledgeable…wait, isn’t that it. Shouldn’t I be happy….2)	The first problem started on day 1 of 2 with the installation. See Tesla doesn’t mention this on their website or even call you beforehand, but pest abatement is extra. This is where they put mesh around your panels to ensure squirrels and birds don’t get in. The cost depends on your size but the original price was $1,500 for the large solar panels…a little much in my opinion and it did feel like a little bait and switch. Also, by going through Tesla it would cover you if any pests did get in. I was told that one chewed wire would cost $700 to fix. If this was the end of the matter I would have still been happy. 3)	I confirmed that I wanted the pest abatement on the second day of the install and they said they would send out a new addendum to the contract. The installers added it. Wonderful, all good. My loan went through for the original price and I was just going to pay Tesla up front for the $1,500 extra when I got the bill. Then…Tesla got paid and everything went silent (they also sent a survey out which I regret giving 5 stars on now). For THREE weeks Tesla did not send any paperwork to my utility company to complete the setup…no solar power, no savings, just paying the loan for something that is not working. Also, it takes the utility company ~4 weeks to turn on the system once they get the paperwork. Tesla has all the paperwork but did not send it. Their excuses: 1)	I did not sign the updated contract with the pest abatement…well, they admitted they forgot to send it. It took them another week to send it…tick tock, no paperwork to the utility company…2)	When they finally did send it the new price was $2,250…yep, they increased the already absurd number. They said they would fix it….another week later and still the wrong price…tick tock, no paperwork sent to the utility company. 3)	Also, during this entire time no one would respond to my calls. You are given one contact (mine was Bever-leigh Holloway) and she would not respond to any of my calls.  I did receive one email after 5 days saying the problem would be fixed in a week or so. There is no one to escalate any issues to good luck. 4)	When I finally got ahold of Bever-leigh, the excuse was they were really backed up, oh, and my calling was only slowing it down more. I am blown away that it is so difficult to send three electronic documents to a utility company. Anyways, my installation was on July 28th, 2020 and it is now September 1st. Tesla is not going to send the paperwork because they are backed up and the pest abatement contract needs to be signed (still has the incorrect price). They will get to fixing the contract in a while. Considering the slow progress, horrible customer service, lack of ability to escalate I do not expect to have the paperwork over to my utility company till mid Sept (if I am lucky) with a potential to have this system on by mid-Oct. My suggestion, go with a local company. They have more skin in the game, better customer service, and the ability to actually get a hold of someone even after you pay them. Oh, and all those recommendations to friends, family and neighbors are gone. My sister-in-law bought them but I am going to try my best to stop anyone else from dealing with this company. It is so sad since I love this company. I will still buy cars from them since I always have the exact opposite experience on that side but I just wish I could have these panels removed and not deal with the solar side.Date of experience: September 01, 2020","{'date_of_review': '2020-09-01', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Abysmal service with a little bait and switch on the side.

In fact, after discussing the entire situation with my insurance broker again, it is clear few insurers (if any) want to insure the new Tesla Model 3 and something has changed in terms of old model to new.

To my relief, it looks like the answer to the question “is it just me?” is no.Too many cars in recent times have had me despairing at the number of controls that have migrated away from physical buttons and onto touchscreens. In some cases this is slightly annoying; in others I believe it’s borderline dangerous. Now the influential car safety rating organisation Euro NCAP has decided that, from 2026, it will award five-star ratings only to cars that retain physical controls for key features.Now that is pretty catastrophic for Tesla impacting not just the facelift Model 3 but the entire direction of the cars themselves. Watch out Tesla stock!My collection has been put off by Tesla until the 20th of March and I’m frustrated and downright annoyed that it’s taken all this to expose what may be the truth.

I will never ever buy Tesla again until the last gas car is available on the market. I was driving home after pickleball with my kid in the car. Some crazy person crashed into me making a left turn, without even hitting their breaks, full speed full force. The hit came on my left (driver) side of the car, deploying my airbags that gave me a second degree burn, both me and my kid had bulged disks and psychological trauma from this. That psychopath who hit me - was making their left turn in the opposite direction, breaking all laws and collecting bunch of tickets from the cops after the collision. Obviously they were legally at fault! But! Knowing that I was in Tesla and only this car has black box - they tried to sue me back!!!! Claiming I was speeding and requesting the black box. Can you imagine? I couldn’t believe that everything I’ve been through- My own Tesla was throwing me under the bus.

I had very bad experience with Tesla customer service. It ended bad because I canceled my order. They not customer friendly. They just act like it. You have to follow their rules if not simply telling you ""cancel the order"". Disinformation all the time. Dealer knows nothing just guessing or contacting by email Tesla support. They not going to hold your car in their facility longer than 3 days even if they messed up the delivery. If you not able to pick up the car in 3 days then you lose it and have to wait another couple of weeks. They told me it was a vin# assigned to my account for delivery but I checked my account several times and nothing was in my account so not even sure it’s true.

Tesla rejected my request to review their pricing and did not give a reason why. Additionally, Tesla provided an authorized contractor that could also do the work and that installer also had pricing significantly less than their costs.(2) Per my original paperwork with Solar City it stated that ""If you need to make repairs on the roof, the solar panels will need to be removed and re-installed. SolarCity offers this service for a reasonable fee.""(3)  Non responsive / Refusing to provide assistance because I contacted the better business bureau.Agents from Tesla would not talk to me because I opened a case with the better business bureau.

Both Matt and Andrew from the Boca Raton site told me that I will not get that money back because they will eventually deliver a car to me. Just imagine, if Tesla gets $100 from a million customers and does not deliver any of those cars, that is $100 million dollars they get to keep in their pocket....

I will start by telling you that we love our Tesla overall, except for 2 very major issues which Tesla local and corporate refuse to address. The first thing is the Phantom Breaking problem which is a really serious safety issue. On rural highways the car will suddenly break without notice and often for no apparent reason. This is by using cruise control only. The highway can be perfectly striped, and with no car in sight. It can also happen when you're passing cars or semi trucks. I would say 85% to 90% of the time it is a soft break. But sometimes it can be a dangerously sudden hard break. I can remember one time when we were passing a semi and the break was so hard that it threw out dog from the middle of the back into the front console area.

Ask Tesla support to look at it and after about 5 emails they stopped answering for over a month leaving us with no charging solution. I chased this multiple time and only got a reply after having to replace the charger with a reliable brand. As the charger is faulty (2 different Tesla models has same issue) asked for them to replace after new charger installed and Tesla one packed back in the box. Seems that a lot of the support staff don't understand that having to wait a long time is unacceptable. Having to now escalate as a formal complaint, but looking at review dont hold much hope that customer service will be given. Luckily the car is due to be replaced in 6 months, so I after all the poor build issues and support service I guess will not be another Tesla now as lost faith in the brand.

I ordered a 2022 Tesla Model 3 for delivery in California. After waiting 9 months, I arranged to pick up the vehicle in Marina Del Rey California, even though I intended to have it registered in my home state of Illinois. When the time for delivery arrived, the Tesla delivery people began making up stories about laws that prevented me from registering the car in Illinois. When I tell them that I have done so twice in the past year they go silent. First, they told me that I would have to pay the full sales tax twice, once in California and then a second time in Illinois. Then they tried telling me that if I didn't drive the car to Illinois and register it within 72 hours I was in big trouble.

On August 11th, I visited the showroom for a used car event after receiving an invitation. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a complete disaster.Upon arrival, there was no one to greet or assist me. After waiting for 10 minutes, I noticed a Tesla employee, Marcello, outside. When I waved to get his attention, he briefly pointed out three used cars that were on sale and didn’t even offer a test drive or to unlock the cars for a closer look. Despite this, I was interested in a Tesla Model Y, but instead of letting me inspect the car, Marcello insisted I put down a £200 deposit. I expressed concern about the non-refundable nature of the deposit, but Marcello assured me that since I was local and buying from the Stockport showroom, the deposit would be refundable if I changed my mind.Unfortunately, I was unable to secure a reasonable trade-in value for my current car and decided not to proceed with the Tesla purchase. On August 19th, I informed Marcello of my decision, and he assured me that my deposit would be refunded. He even sent a message saying, ""The order has been cancelled and the refund process has started. It just needs to be approved, which should happen in a few hours. The money should be back with you within 10-14 working days.""Fast forward to August 30th, and the refund still hadn’t been processed. I sent Marcello a polite message inquiring about the refund and received a shocking reply from Tesla stating, ""The deposit is non-refundable as per the order agreement. No refund has been processed."" This was completely contrary to what Marcello had assured me.I tried to resolve the issue by calling Tesla’s contact number, but it was a nightmare. After waiting 35 minutes, I finally spoke to someone named Jay, who was utterly unhelpful. He informed me that Marcello was working but refused to assist me further, simply telling me to wait for Marcello to call back without any guarantee of when that would happen. Frustrated, I called again later and spoke with Tilda, who was slightly more helpful. She confirmed that Marcello and his showroom manager were off that day, but she would try to process the refund. Despite her promises, I heard nothing back.By August 31st, after several follow-ups, I still had no response. I'm now planning to visit the Stockport store in person to address this issue face-to-face.This experience has been utterly disgusting. I’ve always wanted to buy a Tesla Model Y and was initially excited about the prospect. However, after dealing with this incompetent and unresponsive team, I’m relieved I didn’t go through with the purchase. If their customer service is this abysmal before buying a car, I can’t imagine what it would be like if something went wrong with the vehicle.Save yourself the headache and avoid Tesla Stockport at all costs.

Each time we were reassured our car should be 'on the next shipment'.  But as each delivery estimate came and went, we heard nothing further. At the end of September we emailed Tesla's customer service team to complain about the lack of communication on our order. Our email was sent to a named contact (LH) in the Deliveries team.  Still, we heard nothing further.  We contacted Tesla Customer Services once more who, again, forwarded our email to the Deliveries team. We've heard nothing further. We currently only have an estimated delivery of December 2022 - a year since we placed our order. We appreciate deliveries have been disrupted over recent months.

I thought Saturday was going to be a great day as I picked up my brand new 2023 model Y Tesla. I had done my research, test drove a vehicle, watched a number of video tutorials - I was ready to go! I went to the Chesterfield MO dealership and signed the papers. Everything seemed fine as I was driving down the interstate. However, as I got near Busch Stadium, the car just started to decelerate. Some weird things showed up on the dashboard about the emergency brake being deactivated and I’m just trying to hit the gas and it is not moving. I ended up in the fast lane on the middle of the Poplar Street bridge with a car that wouldn’t move! I was panicking and tried to call the Tesla dealership to ask what I needed to do.

Despite reporting an unusual noise in my Model S over a year and a half ago while it was still under warranty, Tesla dismissed my concerns. Now, with my car out of warranty, I’ve been told the motor needs to be replaced—at my expense.On top of that, a costly battery replacement (100,000 DKK) was necessary immediately after my warranty expired. When I tried to discuss these issues with the supervisor, Henrik, I was met with an uncooperative attitude and no assistance in resolving my concerns.To make matters worse, when I asked for help accessing service history comments in the Tesla App, I was told it wasn’t their responsibility, despite my right to this information. This lack of transparency and accountability has severely impacted my trust in Tesla.

I've had enough of Tesla's deceitful practices and felt compelled to share my terrible experience. Tesla, supposedly a beacon of innovation, has resorted to misleading customers at every turn. Their tactics are disgraceful and unacceptable for a company of this caliber. Tesla may be leading the charge in the electric vehicle market, but their complete disregard for ethical business practices cannot be overlooked. Their arrogant and deceptive approach will undoubtedly catch up with them, and I wouldn't be surprised if they face substantial lawsuits in the near future.

I complained to customer service, providing the email exchange I had documenting the representations made to me. Tesla refused to stand by the representations that were made to me.

I recently purchased a Tesla Model 3 in 2018 and I am beyond impressed with its performance and features. After driving 50,000 miles, I’m happy to report that there has been very little degradation in the vehicle’s battery life. The car has been extremely reliable with no major issues to report. What’s even more impressive is that the car continues to get better with every software update. I love that I never have to visit a gas station and can charge my car from the convenience of my own home. Not only does the car perform exceptionally well, it still looks great even after a few years of use. It’s clear that Tesla is the leader in full self-driving and battery technology, and I am excited to see what they come up with next. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Tesla Model 3 and will always be a loyal customer of this innovative and forward-thinking company.","{'date_of_review': '2023-05-24', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model 3', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': 'I am beyond impressed with its performance and features.', 'technical_pros': ['extremely reliable', 'continues to get better with every software update'], 'other_pros': ['never have to visit a gas station', 'charge my car from the convenience of my own home'], 'technical_issues': [], 'other_issues': [], 'service_experience': 'exceptional', 'overall_experience': 'exceptional'}",True

They really have no idea how to fix a simple problem of the GPS in my car showing the wrong location and as a result navigator not working properly. A simple free app knows exactly where the car is but a 100K car does not! The worse part is that you really have no direct access to a service engineer whom you can talk to! All you can do is call a virtual call centre who then pass your case on to virtual engineers and they keep going round in circles.

Love almost everything about this car. Had it 3 1/2 years with zero problems. It's fast, fun to drive, looks great, has auto pilot, and best of all is totally electric. I have not bought any gas in 3 years and that feels great. Solar panels on the house power the whole house and the car so I can almost drive for free. My few gripes are it's a wide car, too big to fit in a compact parking space. But the interior room is wonderful so you can't have both. I rejected the model 3 for lack of interior space. Visibility out the back window and along the sides is limited but the back camera helps.","{'date_of_review': '2019-12-07', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': 'Love almost everything about this car.', 'technical_pros': ['fast', 'fun to drive', 'looks great', 'auto pilot'], 'other_pros': ['best of all is totally electric', 'has not bought any gas in 3 years and that feels great'], 'technical_issues': [""it's a wide car, too big to fit in a compact parking space""], 'other_issues': ['visibility out the back window and along the sides is limited but the back camera helps'], 'service_experience': '', 'overall_experience': ''}",True

Worse yet, they refused to let me convert the lease to a purchase after I realized the mistake. I was forced to return the car and go through the entire process again, losing non-refundable deposits and incurring unnecessary fees.To make matters worse, I had made it clear I needed the car for ride-sharing, only to learn later that Tesla’s leased vehicles cannot be used for this purpose. I contacted Tesla several times to resolve the issue, but they offered no solution, leaving me frustrated and out of pocket.If you're considering Tesla, beware of their misleading sales practices and lack of transparency.

After reading dozens of negative reviews re Tesla auto repair and Solar Energy installations, it’s a wonder Tesla still continues to offer products. We’re on our 2nd Tesla auto. The 1st one was bought back by Tesla because they refused to continue with repairs. I’m 60 yrs old and I never had that experience with any auto purchase over 40 yrs of driving. The customer service was nonexistent, got the run around, and pushed from one rep to another. Finally got an offer to buy-back the car. I jumped on it. Then the wife wanted another e-car. I regret not waiting to buy a Ford Mach-E, which were on a waitlist. Now stuck with another Tesla. So far, so good.

Only 2 days after delivery of my 2020 model S, various electronic error messages kept showing up - one recurring error was the keys couldn't be detected & that the car would not start if it was turned off - a major problem since the car was turning off by itself at random times (I was on a 6 lane highway when this happened - praying the car would not turn off at the traffic light). A dashboard error kept saying the charger port was open (it wasn't) and other random error messages.

I bought a Tesla S January 2017. I love my car. And the service has been great. I decided I wanted to trade it in for a new Tesla Y. I put a deposit down in NYC on March 7, 2020.  And signed a motor vehicle order agreement. And told the NYC salesperson it would be a trade in. I also told them I wanted to drive the Y before I finalized and they had none available. The pandemic happened. We went upstate. On June 10, I made an appointment to test drive the Y in Mount Kisco NY. I drove the car, enjoyed it and the salesperson took pictures of my Tesla S so he could get me a trade in quote. He had me fill out papers and for some reason I had to pay another $100 order fee.

On June 24th we received a new Tesla model Y. After a couple of days we found damages on all 4 hinges and bolts on both doors on the driver's side (have a lot of pictures). The nature of the damage is such that it is obvious that they did something with the doors, it seems that they hit the hinges and bolts with a hammer or like this, BUT the question is why? When I asked the dealer what exactly they did with this NEW car, the answer is that they do not know, probably on factory. As a result, they offer me to repair a NEW car which worth almost $ 70,000.

In a world where technology and sustainability go hand in hand, my journey with the Tesla Model S has been nothing short of awe-inspiring. From the moment I first laid eyes on this marvel of automotive engineering, it was love at first sight. The sleek design, innovative features, and unparalleled performance of the Model S have captivated my heart and transformed my driving experience.

After owning my Tesla model 3 for 5 years now, I will never go back to driving anything else. My car keeps getting smarter over time and I have not had any major repairs done to it.

I purchased my second Tesla in a matter of two years because I deeply care about contributing to the goal of sustainable energy through high quality electric vehicles. While my experience with the vehicles themselves have been nothing short of amazing, the service has been an embarrassment. I currently serve in the US Army which requires me to be stationed at various locations. The Army has recently sent me to Australia for an assignment lasting two years. Australia is no far flung place that is incapable of accommodating a special vehicle like Tesla, there are already plenty on the roads. The only difference is Australian Tesla's have a different charging port and the steering wheel is on the right side. I have inquired about what service I would be able to receive if I import my Tesla into Australia and was told I would receive no service.

I have leased 3 Tesla model S vehicles since 2015. I was going to order my 4th, but I hate to say that their customer service is the worst experience I’ve ever had with any company. Ever. The leasing company has no idea how to communicate. They send me daily text messages to pay for a lease I transferred through them in 2017. They have tried to bill me for tires on my lease return from 2021 that I bought at their service center. And now with my 2021 car, I have a lemon regarding a left rear tire that prematurely separates the inside wall from the tread every 11 months, long before the other 3 tires need replacement. They’ve told me this is normal. I have tire experts telling me it’s absolutely not normal to happen to the same tire in the same spot 3 times.

I got the Tesla for the technology and safety, but what I love the most is how amazing it is to drive. I use Autopilot 99% of the time on the highway (it drives for me). It keeps me centered and is great for stop-and-go traffic. It drives safer than me. The automatic braking and beeping when there is a risk of collision has saved me from fender benders. It has helped keep me in my lane HUNDREDS of times. I’m a distracted driver. :o

I was really excited to sign up for the annual premium connectivity subscription that Tesla rolled out last year in an effort to save a little money. At the time, I owned a Model 3 and was waiting on my new Model Y to arrive. It took about 9 or 10 months to get my new Model Y at which point I sold my Model 3. I had only had the annual premium connectivity subscription for about 3 months. I assumed - no biggie, I'm sure Tesla will just automatically transfer the subscription to my new Model Y. Well, that didn't happen so then I figured, I should be able to go into the app and transfer it myself. Nope, that didn't work either. Upon calling Tesla, I was informed that premium connectivity is ""non-transferrable"". What this means is ... even if you paid for a year and have time left on that subscription (I had 9 months left on mine), you lose that money if you buy a new Tesla because they won't transfer it to the new Tesla.

Experiencing a Tesla body repair has been a frustrating journey that began in June at Thoroughgood Automotive in Tucson, Arizona, a certified Tesla repair service. While using Full Self-Driving (FSD), my Model X collided with a pole involuntarily, causing an insurance increase through Tesla. The repair process was hindered when the selected shop, Thoroughgood Automotive, had a single certified Tesla technician, leading to a two-month delay before work even started.

So I have owned 2 Tesla S's and am waiting for my 3rd which I was told would be delivered between December 11-24. 2013, 2015. 11/21 - I was called, told my car was ready for pick up and I had 3 days to pick it up (to rearrange my schedule, transfer the payment, clean out my car and get to the delivery location 1.5 hours away. Otherwise, I risk my trade in value changing (going down). And, this is a ""touchless"" delivery so I should watch all the videos and instructions before picking up the car. And oh, by the way, this is a Friday. -Also told for the first time, no more free supercharging for me; trade in quote was valid for less time than their estimated delivery; and they would ""gift"" me 1000 hours of free supercharging - however, they expire in 6 months.

After owning and driving model Y Tesla for 2 years since 2021 I can say that this is by design a good family car, preferably for women and absolutely only for short distances (< 50 miles). The range of 320 miles is a teaser - don’t leave the city if you don’t want to be stranded. It is also not for people who want their car to reflect who they are. Unless of course, you want to be nothing but a green gas efficient ameba. This car is a good practical car for the city, not less not more. It is the Prius of a larger size.

This review is related to my experience owning a brand new Tesla Model S purchased in 2016. I have 78,000 miles on the car and it still runs like new. I love it and would never go back to another gas vehicle in the future. The moment I test drove the car, I thought I was driving something from the future and had to have one. Since then, I am still excited about my car to this day. I've never had a vehicle where I've felt that way after a few months of owning the car. I've had a BMW convertible, Lexus, and others, but the Tesla beats them on almost every metric. Better performance and better tech including on-demand music through Spotify, better self-driving software, better phone app integration, ability to track the car on the phone, adjust everything in the car through the phone, etc. No going back for me!","{'date_of_review': '2023-05-24', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model S', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': 'I love my Tesla and would never go back to another gas vehicle in the future.', 'technical_pros': ['Better performance', 'Better tech including on-demand music through Spotify'], 'other_pros': ['Never felt that way about a car after a few months of owning it'], 'technical_issues': [], 'other_issues': [], 'service_experience': 'exceptional', 'overall_experience': 'exceptional'}",True

I've owned the car for a little over 1 year now. It's not perfect, but what car is? I've had some trouble getting in, where the car isn't picking up my phone key. The worst is, not reaching the destination based on the range provided. Yeah, they tell you it's about your speed, the elevation, the weight and the civilization. Well, what can I say but be weary, especially when you're traveling. You'll be losing (charging) about 15-45 minutes of your time, while the fuel customer is long gone by the time you're finished. If you're travelling abroad, you're adding HOURS to your traveling.

Holy smokes, getting service for a Model S is worse than getting your teeth drilled. I expected way more for a $100,000 car, and at every step, the process of scheduling and receiving service significantly sours my ownership experience. I have a suggestion.... At Tesla, maybe there needs to a greater investment in human capital, some better lessons in customer service, and some process improvement in how to perform closed-loop communication. Sometimes text sessions through the app just don't cut it.

My car's cruise control and safety features were disabled while traveling long distance for a week. This action was taken by Tesla supposedly as a safety precaution because while driving both hands were not on the steering wheel. I was disgusted, alarmed and felt taken advantage of because Tesla wants their owners to purchase the self driving packages, so they have resorted to underhanded and aggressive measures such as taking away features you supposedly own and purchased already in an attempt to further coerce owners to buy their other products. I had a Cadillac and a KIA Telluride that had enhanced cruise control that relied on eye contact and even when it deemed you tired it would ban cruise control for a couple of hours at the max, Tesla’s latest action is truly greedy and despicable especially to prohibit features meant to save lives when they are necessary the most.

Have owned Hybrids since 2003, so going EV was the next step! Leased a long range model Y and am well pleased so far. Generally, I like the roomy interior, the techno gadgetry and the performance. Not too concerned with range anxiety since I still have a Hybrid Highlander for our travel car! Feel like the auto pilot, and the feel of their system is not quite as sophisticated as my Highlander or Venza and really feel the Tesla needs a digital rear view mirror and heads up display! Otherwise I like the drive and feel of the Tesla. It feels a little more sports car’ish and is generally very comfortable, quiet, and refined.

I am in my second lease, my first was a Model 3 for 2 years, & now I have a Model Y lease & I'm in month 14th of 36 months. I have to say that it is very sad that Tesla's lack of customer interaction and customer service is at this level. Once upon a time you could speak to people and get actual help when you called or emailed and now it's gone to poop, not to use the actual term I want to use. It's truly a shame because it's this lack of help that will definitely keep me from ever endorsing Tesla to anyone. I was a huge fan & believer & would always tell everyone who asked how much I loved having one but not anymore. It's a definite big disappointment.

I've had my Tesla Model S for a little over 4 years now. When I initially purchased it, they screwed up the initial figures on the contract, gave me some foolery about a mistake and charged me an additional 5k almost 1 month after having the car. I sucked it up because I was already in love with the car. Never had any real issues with the car... Fast forward April 2020. My screen started bubbling, I called in and mobile service came out to replace it because I was still under warranty. During the replacement of the screen, they cracked my dashboard. Assured me they would take care of it by just simply ordering a replacement dash and changing the 2nd row cup holder, so the woodgrain matched. I did not make a big deal over it and just chalked it up as an accident. Months go by and I keep getting part update emails but no parts.

For the cost of the Tesla X, I expected better. The glass roof does not have visor to protect against the glaring sun. The Tesla app offers a tacky ineffective sun shield for $80 which you can get on Amazon for $40. The sun visor is tiny & useless. The hack steering wheel is clumsy to use. The turn signals are buttons that you press many time and don’t work consistently. The driver seat cannot be adjusted up & down, which is a feature on most standard SUVs. The drive and shift is bumpy. The electronic controls are erratic and don’t work consistently, for example, the close and open door features don’t work consistently. The side mirror is tinted and this difficult to use at night. There are now reports that the auto drive may be dangerous thus I am not inclined to use it.

In the beginning, the car would always be washed, recharged and we were met with smiles at the Tesla office. Now.... nothing. It's just a struggle now. The employees know nothing about why these things are happening either :( Finally, because of the referral, I did they promised a ""Signature Black Tesla Wall Connector"" ... It's been a year now.

I recently became the proud owner of a Tesla Model 3, and I couldn't be happier! This car is the epitome of futuristic technology, bringing an entirely new driving experience to the table. From the moment I sat in the driver's seat, I knew I was in for something extraordinary. The first thing that struck me was the minimalist yet sleek interior. The large touchscreen display, resembling a tablet, commands attention and seamlessly controls every aspect of the vehicle. With just a few taps, I can adjust the climate settings, access entertainment options, and even navigate with real-time traffic updates. It's like having a personal assistant right at my fingertips.

We bought our model y after our model 3. My wife drives the model 3 and it’s her first car and loves her car. I used to love drive stick shift/manual transmission roadsters because I love driving and feel of the road. However, once my wife got the 3, I felt in love with the convenience of charging at home and the instant torque and autopilot. So I put in the order for model x. Meanwhile waiting, I lost patience and bought a model Y to tie me over until X arrives. Y was more spacious than model 3 and we camp in the car with 2 adults and 2 kids and it was fantastic. So far the 3 and Y had no problems at all other than windshield wiper fluid. The big screen is amazing for navigation and it’s much better than CarPlay or android auto.

This morning around 10am I was going to go to the market but I realized that my Tesla Model 3 was turned off even though it was charging. I was super surprised because this had never happened before. I tried to contact support through the Tesla app and they sent a tow truck to supposedly tow the car to the nearest Tesla dealership but the person Tesla sent was from a third party company and he just opened the car and charged it for 3 minutes on the battery in the front of the car and said it was fixed and there was no need to tow it to Tesla. I told him I had to work in the afternoon and if it was safe to drive. He said yes and left.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=8,"Not the tech-forward purchase experience I was expecting...I am disappointed to have to write a negative review before I even take delivery of a Tesla. Whilst it's clear to me that Tesla have, by and large, an excellent product, it is equally clear that important aspects of their customer service fall very short of what might be acceptable, let alone excellent.  For a tech-forward company that has had a considerable number of years to hone its customer facing processes, I was shocked to find that significant aspects of the pre-purchase and delivery processes are not well integrated, leading to an underwhelming customer experience and falling well short of my average expectations. My complaints fall into the following categories:Finance deals available via the Tesla app/website are not actually available from their finance partner (Santander).  I was, for example, unable to apply for a 12 month initial rental personal contract hire deal with Santander, even though Tesla was happy to take an order on that basis in their app.Finance approval took an inordinate amount of time by modern standards, with Santander taking 4 days to approve my application and an indeterminate amount of time thereafter to file “paperwork” with Tesla. Tesla will fix but then unilaterally move delivery dates.  They understandably need finance to have been approved before delivery but once approved, they then introduced a new hurdle, advising that they needed to await the receipt of “paperwork” from Santander before they could release the car, introducing additional collection delays.  In total (so far) they have moved my delivery (collection) date 3 times, the last two of which were without prior consultation.  This has caused me genuine inconvenience and expense.Let’s hope things get better henceforth.

Driving a Tesla is great fun but I am not sure I would buy it again. $65,000 for so much hassle! After the car got clipped/dinged on the driver's side rear end, it took a month to get in the shop because there is only one shop in the state of MI that does collision repair. Other shops have opted out recently due to issues with Tesla service in parts procurement. Now I am in the process and see the examples. There is a rear panel on back order they need for my car. It has been a week and Tesla has not even responded whether it is available now and I know because I am included with a Tesla service account shop made for me. So the shop wasn’t sure if they should keep the car/start for the past week and we are in limbo whether to get the long contract for the loaner car. The parts apparently can’t be returned to Tesla (unlike other car companies) once ordered so it makes for repairs being done in several stages, doubling the time at least.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=1,"It's hard to describe how bad the Tesla…It's hard to describe how bad the Tesla Service process is.Tiny queries and questions take forever. The team can only be contacted via the fiddly App. The fiddly App is barely fit for purpose. It requires your address and yet when you try to enter the address it will not find it (unless you happen to live in New York or maybe number 10 Downing street).Good luck with getting a reply from Tesla. It's patchy at best and most of the time they will come back with a further question and certainly not the answer you're looking for - which will add another few hours to the process.Parts are very hard (impossible) for regular mechanics to get hold of, so the driver has to request via the app. Unless the driver happens to also be a mechanic then good luck, because there will be questions!!The only chance anyone has of getting anything done is to book an appointment at a Tesla service centre. There aren't many, so get ready for a drive. The most recent booking I just made was a disaster. First they have limited appointments, then they send me a quotation to ""approve"". The quotation was around 10 times what I expected because they added parts covering every eventuality, including many hours at £165/hr to fit them all. The approval system doesnt work for me - it just takes me to my app which has no information, so i had to request a manual email with attachment. Got there after a few hours. Of course Tesla then say they don't know how long the fix will take, and say it will ""most likely roll over into the next day"". They do not provide a courtesy car (apparently only available on warranty repairs), and suggested i book one of their vehicl test drives on the same day, and use that. I have a 2 hour journey to get home so I need to find some way of getting there. No idea whether they are expecting me to take the vehicle home, but also no way of asking as there are no numbers you can reach Tesla Bristol on.Date of experience: September 13, 2024","{'date_of_review': '2024-09-13', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'The Tesla Service process is bad.

I wanted to badly to love my new Tesla. Purchased a 2023 Tesla Model 3 in February 2023. First, their virtual customer service was the absolute worst experience. I actually wanted to buy a car that was available in the state of NV (I live in AZ) at a dealership but the representative said I could not buy a car outside of the state I resided in. What? Since when? I would have registered it, etc. in AZ. That representative was very rude, hung up on me numerous times yet I was stuck with him if I wanted to buy any Tesla. A ridiculous system.

Things you should know before buying a Tesla. Service department is awful. You will lose your car for days just for a flat tire. Home charging station is impossible to get Repaired under warranty and it will give you problems. If there is an issue with your lease or finance you will have to contact Tesla finance via email which they rarely respond to. If you do get a hold of a human they couldn’t care less about your problems. They are trained to do damage control only. Get a reliable gas powered car that you don’t have to depend on awful Tesla services. My Tesla is sitting in my driveway and I haven’t been able to drive it for months due to registration issues and charging problems.","{'date_of_review': '2020-10-17', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Things you should know before buying a Tesla.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Home charging station is impossible to get Repaired under warranty and it will give you problems.', 'Registration issues'], 'other_issues': ['Service department is awful', 'You will lose your car for days just for a flat tire', 'Tesla finance via email rarely responds', 'They are trained to do damage control only'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

The Model Y has been a game-changer for me. I would argue this is the best all round vehicle you can buy on the planet, not just the best EV. I used to drive a Honda Accord and I thought I had a pretty good vehicle until I got to drive a Model 3 and a Model Y. The Model Y specifically stood out to me because of its utility. I rented a 2022 Model Y LR for a long road trip (~4000 kms) and ended up deciding to buy one as my next car. The vehicle is incredible and packed with seamless technology. Most of which can only be found on a Tesla.

(+ 1610€ to install Tesla charger at home)Although I wanted to buy the car only in 2019, Tesla people pushed me to buy it sooner to get free supercharging …  •	A few months later, Tesla reduced the price of my car by 50.000 €.•	Free loading: forget about it:  95% of charging happens at home.  When charging outside, one must wait a very long time – normal loader something like 35 hours, fast loader about + 6 hours.  All this if you find a loader somewhere!•	The money saved on the fuel, you will spend in the snack bar/restaurant waiting for your car to be ready …Sales people in Lisbon (Portugal) are good in their job …; One time we were invited for a small briefing how the car works …  No details – the rest one must find on the internet.After sale = zero;   repair assistance = zero (see further)Range:  so beautiful on paper – reality is so much different.  I live in the Algarve about 250 km away from Lisbon. I cannot reach our capital city without having to lose a few hours to charge. Unless you behave and do not more than 250 Km/hrIn October, after a first wash, we noted that at the rear and on the right wheel there were 2 spots of white paint.  Sent picture to Tesla Portugal and got a reply: “whenever” you come to Lisbon our maintenance will have a look at it …End of October 2018, I sent my first report to Tesla Portugal:Quote:  Objective report on my newly bought Tesla X P100D•	Must be fully loaded to get best/highest (?) acceleration.•	Tesla: The acceleration doesn’t depend that much on the battery level.•	R/ oh yes it does – after 50/75 km one can already feel the difference!•	Rearview mirror inside far too small and does not adapt itself to the driver•	Tesla: To have the best view to the back you can always connect the rear-view camera that gives you a panoramic view of the back. The central rear-view mirror can adapt to yourself manually like any car.•	R/ rear view is on and is perfect – some other luxury cars adapt themselves to the drivers and mirror should have been bigger•	When one closes the car completely (3 clicks) the windows remain open•	Tesla: At this moment we don’t have the automatic closing of the windows. However, we might have it in a future update.•	R/ find this an important shortcoming and a dangerous one.•	No handles above windows•	Tesla: That’s right, we don’t have these handles.•	R/ again a shortcoming for a luxury car•	Compared to my Mercedes S there is little luxury (no TV, no bar, no incorporated tables, no cloth hangers, not everybody  can control temperature in the car, headrests not adjustable, no sunshades for windows,  passengers seat/back cannot  be put down (bed), back massage inside the seats not available, quality of finishing low etc. …)•	Tesla: We are aware that we don’t have these features in our car, however we have some that we believe that are far more important than this, like our Autopilot, over the air updates, etc.•	R/ autopilot which is not allowed in Portugal – and still you sold it to me! … many updates still to be done then …•	When car is closed there is no automatic collapse of the rearview mirrors outside•	Tesla: You can enable this feature on controls>settings>vehicle>Mirror Fold ON•	R/ ok will do (note afterwards: it worked for a while and had to install it again several times)•	GPS still must be handled manually – all modern cars are now by voice instruction/recognition.•	Tesla: You have the voice control where you can tap and say “Navigate To…” and it will show the course on the main screen.•	R/ ok will try it out•	By cleaning the car by high pressure, water infiltrates on two places•	Tesla: Must be checked by Service Center one of these days that you come to Lisbon•	R/ pse give me address, contact and names so we can make a reservation ahead of time (no answer yet …)•	When in drive position and standstill the car rolls back•	Tesla: Creep mode must be OFF, turn Creep mode ON.•	R/ ok where do I find this?

No side/downwards sensors! Several times already, when closing the doors, people walking by, were hit!Worse: When door(s) are open, and one starts driving, there is no alarm! The car should not even be allowed to start driving with an open door (e.g. BMW has this) – and when I am in a hurry I do not have time to study the dashboard.Result: left wing door was still open, and I started driving the car outside the carport. (from inside the car, via the outside mirror one cannot see this) – serious crash.So, we contacted Tesla Portugal who gave us a their ‘caroçaria aprovada pela Tesla’ (approved garage) .  We are beginning of February 2019.This seemed to be a Mercedes garage close to Lisbon.  After a while we were notified that the car had to be moved to another Mercedes garage as they could not do this.We talked to the people at Mercedes nr. 2Quote: we will “try” to repair the car …? Yes, will try as this is the first time we do this, and we do not get any assistance from Tesla …  (and indeed see below)Today we are + two months further: No news whatsoever!Waiting – hoping – crying … Unbelievable …  got the car back: 22.04.2019 = almost 3 months after the accident …  Have sent this report to Tesla … No action, no reaction, no reply whatsoever …Just hoping now my car will not start burning …Last comments:When you put a bicycle rack on the back of the car, the distance given on the screen is not correct.The cruise control is very irregular – sometimes the cars stop when it detects another car 15 meter ahead sometimes +50 meter ahead.  It also stops ruffianly iso slowing down when detecting car in front.  It should take the speed of the car in front but does not do it most of the time.Worse and bloody dangerous: when overtaking a truck, being on the same height of the truck the car did a cheeky braking (at 150 km/hr.)Did something go wrong when repairing the falcon door?I cannot close the door anymore from the outside (red bottom)The (repaired ?) door does not open anymore or only partly after a lot of insistance  and indicates there is an obstacle when there is none!The car does not ‘dance’ anymore.Few days ago, we drove to Huelva (Spain) of course no battery enough.  Called Tesla for info – no reply on all numbers known to me - maybe I am already on a blacklist? Computer told me I could load in Alcacer (about 500 km away) but could not reach it with actual reserve… hallo ?After few hours we found a normal (not Tesla) loader in a shopping center.  Although the car was standing still for over 2 hours it refused to be loaded (Manuel book indicates no loading when batteries are warm …)Nice car guys !Wondering if anybody at Tesla worldwide will have the politeness, the courage and or the willingness to react to this mail !?Anybody willing to repair this car !???rest next msgDate of experience: July 14, 2019","Invalid json output: I'm so sorry to hear about all the issues you're experiencing with your Tesla. It sounds like a lot has gone wrong, and I can understand why you're frustrated.

As an assistant, I don't have direct access to Tesla's systems or customer service, but I can try to help you gather information and potentially get in touch with someone who might be able to assist you.

Firstly, it seems like there are several issues that need attention:

1. The Falcon wing doors not functioning properly
2. No automatic parking, panic stop, or email functionality
3. Front window cleaner irregularities
4. Driver's door not opening fully automatically
5. Remote control issues with the car and gate
6. Sensors not detecting obstacles when closing the doors
7. Alarm not sounding when doors are open while driving
8. Serious crash due to an open door

It's concerning that you've had no response from Tesla Portugal or the approved garage, Mercedes nr. 2.

I'd like to help you gather more information and potentially get in touch with someone who can assist you. Can you please provide me with the following details:

1. Your car's VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)
2. The exact dates of when each issue started
3. Any correspondence or communication you've had with Tesla Portugal or the approved garage

Additionally, I'd like to ask a few questions:

1. Have you tried contacting Tesla's customer service directly?
2. Are there any specific concerns or fears you have about your car's safety and reliability?

Please feel free to share as much information as you're comfortable with, and I'll do my best to help you get in touch with someone who can assist you.

Remember, I'm here to listen and help in any way I can.",False

Through FREE Over-the-Air updates, my car keeps getting better over time, Sentry Mode, Dog Mode, constant Self-Driving updates, tons of safety updates such as being able to check out the surroundings of your car on your phone app before walking into a dark parking lot. Tesla constantly analyzes crash data then they reconfigure brakes and seat belts through Over-the-Air updates to give drivers the best chance of avoiding/surviving a crash. My Model 3 even got a free software upgrade in 2019 that gave it more range and made it quicker, and there is an paid option to make it even faster.

Tesla Customer Service loses good customers! Tesla Customer service is the worse I have ever experience, and it is getting worse by the month. From the first time I purchased a Signature Series Model S to today is like night and day, I think they think that people are like their cars, cold and robotic, that is totally unacceptable. I have purchased since their inception 3 Model S and one Model X. My last Model S a P100D was $160,000. You think they care about a good returning customer. Not a bit. There is no way, no matter how good a customer you have been, to speak to customer service. So why call it customer service! Just app, email, and press 1 to get ignored, press 2 to get annoyed, press 3 to tell you how other have asked your question, press 4 to repeat since you are a moron. Thankfully, now there are other electric car options in the market. So there goes their customers and stock value.","{'date_of_review': '2019-12-20', 'vehicle_model': 'Signature Series Model S', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Tesla Customer Service loses good customers!', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['no technical issues mentioned'], 'other_issues': ['no non-technical issues mentioned'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

I bought my car in 2014, loved it. Enjoyed the vehicle tremendously. Over the years, customer service started to take a very clear lower priority to other factors (profitability) for the company. 5.5 years in, my car's infotainment center failed. This means the car is essentially undrivable. This is also due to an eMMC memory chip failure that Tesla knows about and affects every single vehicle built between 2013 and 2018, and yet does nothing about. Instead, they wait for the infotainment center to fail and charge you around $3,000 to repair the problem. Note, this is affecting every single vehicle between 2013 and 2018.

To start I have been trying to help a Tesla owner get linked with his car myself for over a month. He purchased his Tesla from a Car Dealer in Michigan in Aug of 2019. Today is Oct 30 2019 and they still have not granted him transfer of ownership of the vehicle which in turns ""links"" him to that vehicle so that he can use the Tesla App to schedule service and so on. The day it was purchased he sent in all the required paperwork to their ownership transfer email they provided. They never responded and someone closed out his ownership case with nothing being done and him never being contacted.

I have no doubt Tesla makes good cars, but the customer service is terrible. I picked up my Model S from Decatur Ga. A power outage occurred, I understand they have no control on that. It is their lack of efforts to resolve unexpected problems when they arise. After they pull my car to parking lot outside, I was left alone in the dark showroom for 2 hours. All the Tesla personnel were staying in the back room chatting where I found the delivery lady a couple of times for questions. I told them I was on a tight schedule. They didn't pay attention or offer any solution. When I asked for a loaner car because my ride had left, the manager disappeared. Finally, the power came back. It took the delivery lady 20 minutes to print out the temporary tag. She gave me an attitude when I went to the backroom to ask her when the tag is ready the second time.

There was no evidence ofexternal impact or damage when I parked the car the evening before.Concerned, I brought the vehicle to the Tesla Service Center in Tuzla,Istanbul, for a thorough inspection.At the service center, Mr. Sezer and his team conducted a detailedexamination and confirmed that there were no signs of external impactor debris collision on the windshield.

It was suggested that thecrack could not have developed without an external cause, even thoughno such cause was evident.The team also mentioned that the nature of the crack did not suggestit was due to stress or a manufacturing/assembly defect. However, Ibelieve this conclusion may have overlooked possible latent defects orunusual stress fractures that could occur without external impact,especially given the age and condition of the vehicle.Given Tesla's reputation for quality and customer care, this decisionis unexpectedly disappointing and seems inconsistent with theprinciples of fairness and customer satisfaction.

The Tesla Model Y is by far the best car I have ever owned. The car represents a huge jump in technology compared to other legacy vehicles. It is designed with minimal hardware and rather than relying on a touchscreen for controlling most functions of the vehicle. So virtually all controls can be updated via free over-the-air updates via Wi-Fi while your car sits in the car. The only maintenance needed so far is a tire rotation and windshield wiper fluid after 17,000 miles! It charges in our garage and is always ready to go. No more gas stations. The Tesla Model Y is one of the safest cars ever built.

Tesla cars are one of the best cars in the world. To begin with, Teslas are electric cars so it helps the environment. Because they don’t use gas and instead of putting gas you charge them. Also, when you don’t wanna drive you can put the Tesla into self drive mode. Elon Musk announced that Teslas have a self drive mode which allows the car to self drive without any assistance. Critics may say that the Tesla is a bad choice in a vehicle because it's expensive; however, you can pay 20% of the price of the vehicle as a down payment.","{'date_of_review': '2021-10-14', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla cars', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': 'Teslas are one of the best cars in the world.', 'technical_pros': ['electric cars', 'self drive mode'], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': [], 'other_issues': [], 'service_experience': 'exceptional', 'overall_experience': 'exceptional'}",True

Title: The Deception of TESLA: Overpriced and Underwhelming Electric Vehicles. In recent years, the world has witnessed an electrifying revolution in the automotive industry. Electric vehicles (EVs) have taken center stage, promising cleaner and more sustainable transportation options for the masses. TESLA, however, has managed to overshadow this noble pursuit by robbing EV car enthusiasts blind with its underwhelming offerings that come at a premium price. Recent significant price drops have only shed light on the scandalous tactics this car maker has employed in creating and riding on an overhyped wave of excitement.

I was contacted by a Tesla representative via email to asked to call them regarding an option to get into a new vehicle and end my current lease early. This is all fraud. I was told I could order a new car and get out of the old car early with no penalty. I proceeded to order the car and when it was delivered and I returned the old leased vehicle I received a bill for the remaining months on the old car that I no longer have.

If could give Tesla no stars I would. They do not communicate. They do not keep records well and most importantly they do not support their customers. Rewind to 2018 when I got divorced-I call to get the account transferred out of my ex-husband‘s name and into mine and to change my last name on the account back to my maiden name. At that time I was told that everything was done and everything was settled and I have been receiving my bills and I was under the impression that it was until I went to sell my home and transfer the lease agreement. This was hands-down the worst experience ever. Not only did they not take my ex-husband off of the account, they have record of the request to take him off and change my name and didn’t do either still as of this day!

Hi everyone. We've just bought a Tesla 3 here in China. As for the car it is ok but that is really a city car, on high speed or on freeway the range goes down very quickly...Also I do not know in the US or in Europe but in China the model 3 feels cheap in term of material. Also we were very unfortunate...Sales at the shop pushed us very hard to buy and go pick up the car... The saleswoman was very nice and positive prior to purchase. Ten days after we learned from the news that in China Tesla decreased price by 12% about 4500 usd. If we would have picked up the car 3 days after (we were being pushed hard to pick up asap) we would have been compensated...We went complaining and then attitude of the staff in the shop was very different...Basically nothing can be done and too bad for us... That is really very poor attitude towards customer...Customer service and the feeling we have from it is terrible... so be careful and ask if the price won't change the week after....","{'date_of_review': '2020-10-06', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla 3', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'The car is okay but feels cheap in terms of material.

I've been very patient with this company. I'm on my third Tesla and absolutely love the car. I understand the growing pains of a new company and have that consideration in this review. My first Tesla was a used 2015 Model S 85D, back when I bought it, Tesla provided pictures of the car and showed the car's defects. The car was located 370 miles away from me and took a considerable effort on my part to take delivery. After driving 7 hours to the car's location, they attempted to deliver the car to me with paint and body damage along with a malfunctioning hood lock. I refused delivery and had to rent another car to drive the 370 miles back home.

My Model Y was new in December 2023 today (July) I have noticed the drivers window has several large cracks in the inner pane that have suddenly appeared. The car is possibly safe to drive as it is a double glazed unit but I am concerned the pane may shatter internally onto me. There are no mobile appointments available on the app and the first service centre appointment is in 24 days. I spoke to a very rude gentleman in the roadside assist number as it was the only human I could speak to after spending nearly an hour ringing lots of different Tesla numbers. He told me I needed to take the car to a service centre, couldn't seem to understand that I don't feel safe driving it. Eventually he told me to repair it myself!!! My warranty is 4 years which includes defective parts. As far as I am concerned the window is a part and it is defective otherwise it wouldn't have cracked on the inside with no impact. I am now in the position of having to pay Autoglass either £240 going through my insurance company which will have further implications or £1,124 if I pay it myself. Apparently if I get a report from a glass installer saying it is defective then I may have some recompense via Tesla but who do I even send the report, photos and receipt to?

This is my second Tesla as I just traded up my 2018 Model 3 for a 2021 Model Y. Cars are really great and if you like the latest technology, this is a car to own. It is light years ahead of any other car. The comfort is ok. The Model Y is much better than the 3, but not amazing. The self drive is what really hooks me. It boosts my productivity and studies. However, it is hard to deal with Elon's arrogance seen in any issues the car has. It is passed down to the employees and is amazingly brash. For example, they told me in my upgrade I would have all the same features. This was So not true! They took away most of the self drive features like auto navigation, summons and self park and now make you buy the $10,000 package that my old car had free. They never would do anything to make their word right and don't answer emails or phone calls even have the gall to cancel your service appointment without giving a call or text (rather by just putting it on the app).

If I could give them a zero I would. I bought panels in 2015 when it was Solar City. Tesla bought them and since then nothing but issues. To get a hold of a live person is impossible. All you get is someone on chat. I've been complaining about them for yrs and no one helps. I had to write a letter to the BBB in order to get any action. I had an appt scheduled for June 28th, the day before they called me to reschedule because they need 2 people. They had this appt for over a week and conveniently the day before they realized it. Now I have to wait till July 26th and take a day off because they don't work sat and sun, so the customer needs to inconvenience themselves for Tesla. I'm so disappointed in this company and their customer service. I hope to get this resolved.","{'date_of_review': '2024-06-27', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'If I could give them a zero I would.

Where do I start. Customer Service is atrocious at times. No loaners anymore. No Ubers. My front left tire has busted 3 times now, for hitting a small pothole, all 3 times. Not even a huge one. Cost me $550 a pop. Ride quality is not good. It’s a Model X. Spent $3800 yesterday to fix the windshield and the Falcon door top glass. I understand it can be due to external factors but Tesla Insurance is not integrated with Tesla Service so the claim is not covered automatically. Appointments take ages. Can’t get rid of it because the price has dropped to a ridiculous $51k for a 2023 model per Carvana. Don’t know what to do with this thing. Don’t fall for it. It is NOT worth it.","{'date_of_review': '2024-08-30', 'vehicle_model': 'Model X', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Where do I start.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=19,"Long Term OwnershipMy experience .. I've had my S 75 RWD since Dec 2017. I've driven over 26k relatively trouble free miles including a recent 2k round trip to the Italian Alps & back last Winter. Tesla's coupe d'etat is their supercharging network, it is second to none & I didn't need do any trip planning beyond a distance map on A Better Route Planner to work out where to book overnight & expect meal stops. The in-car navigation system handled getting us from door-to-door admirably. When permitted, we also drive all over the UK and often go on impromptu day trips which we would never have done in my old car due to cost of petrol. We use the supercharger network whenever we do this, we've never had to use another public charging system, & there is zero inconvenience .. we simply stop for food as we would have to do anyway & plug the car in. The car is usually ready to go before we are! In general day-to-day use we charge at home from solar power where we can or low cost overnight electricity from a renewable supplier where we can't. I can even top-up, for free, when I go shopping as Tesco has multiple free-to-use PodPoint chargers.My car is a joy to drive. I have the performance of a BMW M3 (mine is a ""slow"" Tesla), Spotify on tap for music, TuneIn for podcasts, a HEPA filter to deal with city pollution, funky country smells & hayfever then AutoPilot to top it all and take the strain on long motorway journeys. All the while cruising along in serene silence emitting zero CO2. I have an app to allow me to heat or cool my car remotely, to let someone into my car & drive it if I need them to even if I'm in another part of the world & I receive regular software updates that add features that my car didn't have when I bought it (a built in dashcam, a video alarm system, ""dog mode"" to allow animals/people/cream cakes to stay in the car on hot/cold days and maintain the temperature, a multitude of in-car games).I have taken my car to a local HEVRA garage to have it checked over for roadworthy-ness twice, Tesla do not mandate servicing but I feel an annual mechanical check-up is wise. I've not had to change my wiper blades, tyres, brake pads or brake discs (despite having attended 2 separate runway days to safely see just how fast my car will go (140mph) and to test the handling on very wiggly sprint circuits); I've had the HEPA filter cleaned and the pollen filter changed; I have had to top up my screen wash several times .. the costs have been minimal.I've had some warranty claims which have usually been resolved quickly and with minimal fuss, usually by a mobile technician at a place of my choosing, work or home. Issues have been: some cabin rattles/squeaks (you wouldn't have noticed these in a petrol/diesel vehicle due to engine noise), some wind noise (again, would not have been noticeable in a none electric vehicle), a failed bonnet solenoid (manual unlatching was still possible), a steering rack squeak (more grease required) and a seat pad which mysteriously discoloured.I've deducted 1 star as there is always room for improvement & customer communication from Tesla could be better. Because of this they tend to seem a little disorganised when it comes to vehicle collection/service even if, in actual fact, things as far as they're concerned, are all good.So, I would recommend Tesla but with the caveat of they are a tech company making electric vehicles, not a car company trying to do an EV. Tesla will sell you a car in the same way that Apple will sell you a phone .. don't expect them to flatter your ego on the way. If you like buttons & traditional cabins with dealers that fawn over you whilst trying to get an up-sell of some sort, then they won't be for you. If you are a bit of a tech geek willing to accept a bit of rough-round-the-edges while they get it right, well, you won't find a faster ""milk float"" ;)Date of experience: June 11, 2020","{'date_of_review': '2017-12-01', 'vehicle_model': 'S 75 RWD', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': 'Long Term OwnershipMy experience ...', 'technical_pros': ['Smooth ride', 'Great fuel efficiency'], 'other_pros': ['joy to drive', 'performance of a BMW M3'], 'technical_issues': ['some cabin rattles/squeaks', 'some wind noise', 'failed bonnet solenoid', 'steering rack squeak', 'seat pad discoloured'], 'other_issues': [], 'service_experience': 'exceptional', 'overall_experience': 'good'}",True

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=12,"Tesla UK Customer Service is terrible…Tesla UK Customer Services is really awful. My brand new Model 3 was damaged (through no fault of mine) and needed a new front wing. More than two months on and the ETA has just been extended to the end of April - a further 4 weeks, with no guarantees it will arrive then. The UK contact centre were no help whatsoever and simply referred me to the parts depot in Europe. Apparently they are unable to contact them on behalf of a customer. I don’t know why. I tried to escalate the matter, but it’s impossible. The emails simply go back to the same unhelpful team, who do nothing. Senior execs., it would appear, either don’t exist, or if they do, they consider themselves too high and mighty to communicate with their customers. Happily, Karl Vella managed to find me the necessary part from within their own business and were able to repair my car, but it was no thanks to Tesla. I realise that there are many issues affecting supply chains just now, but Tesla’s lousy communication and ‘couldn’t care less’ approach is unforgivable.In short Teslas are great cars, but the experience is ruined by the lack of a decent support network in the UK.PS - Another cause for complaint - Referral Miles Fiasco:I ordered my car whilst the referral miles offer was in place and using the link that I had been given by another Tesla owner. The miles were not added. 6 months on and, despite sending them a screenshot of the actual WhatsApp conversation in which I received the link, they replied insisting that no link was used and, by implication, saying that I had lied. They would not accept that their computer system could possibly have been at fault, even though one of their own colleagues had admitted that my experience was not unique.I actually don’t use their supercharging network much, as there are none close to my home, but, on principle, if something is offered, the offer should be honoured. This company produces very good cars, but it shows no concern whatsoever for its customers and it’s impossible to escalate a complaint.

I couldn't be happier with my Tesla Model Y Long Range. The car drives really well and the software and navigation are just the best. I owned an Audi in the past and I'd choose the Tesla over that vehicle every time. Plus, the Tesla Supercharger network is so convenient and the level of integration with the navigation system is shockingly good. I've read nightmare stories about Electrify America and I couldn't imagine attempting to rely on that network when traveling. I had a slight service issue and I used their app to request service. It was a seamless experience and the technician came to my house at the scheduled time. The level of communication and convenience was beyond what I'd experienced with Amazon. Lastly, I get to remotely trigger the 'fart noise' while watching the cameras on my phone--a feature my wife isn't too fond of.","{'date_of_review': '2023-05-24', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model Y Long Range', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': ""I couldn't be happier with my Tesla Model Y Long Range.

In May, Tesla launched a compelling promotion featuring an exceptional 0.99% interest rate. Recognizing this as a prime opportunity, I made the decision to trade in my 2022 Tesla Model Y, which had clocked 49,800 miles, for a new model. With Tesla's recent price reductions in mind, I was conscious of the substantial negative equity I had accumulated, prompting me to seize this promotion as a solution to address the imbalance, secure a new vehicle with warranty coverage, and resolve the financial situation.

I ordered my Tesla at the end of April 2021. I was told that I would take 6 to 8 weeks for me to get my vehicle. I’m at the end of June and I receive an email, with contracts, insurance purchased, and extras purchased, all 2 days prior to my arrival date. I signed papers, I got a Vin number and the number of miles (15) on my odometer. The night before my car is supposed to be delivered I get a phone call telling me that my car will not be arriving and they have no explanation as to why. I sold my own car that same day thinking I was going to have a new car the next day and now that car is not arriving as stated in the contract. I have no way to get to work and does Tesla care? No. They even stated that they do not have any idea when I will see my Tesla. They said it could take another 9 to 13 weeks before I get a car.

I was very happy with my Tesla Model Y until I had an accident. It is exactly one month and 22 days since the body shop ordered the parts from Tesla and they didn't receive any response. Tesla part section even doesn't tell them anything about the approximate time of part delivery. I loved Tesla but right now I changed my mind. Tesla just wants to make the cars and sell them and they don't care about service after selling at all. My accident was in July first and I was waiting for the insurance decision up to Sept 8 (They were also very slow: the co-operative insurance). On Sept 8 the parts were ordered by the body shop. Today is October 31 with no response. I suggest others not to buy a Tesla.","{'date_of_review': '2023-11-01', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model Y', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'I was very happy with my Tesla Model Y until I had an accident.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': [""The body shop ordered the parts from Tesla and they didn't receive any response""], 'other_issues': [""Tesla part section even doesn't tell them anything about the approximate time of part delivery"", 'They were also very slow: the co-operative insurance'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

This was the absolute WORST experience I have ever had buying a new car. As soon as we arrived for our afternoon appointment we were unable to find any sort of parking. We drove around the lot multiple times and finally parked in front of another vehicle hoping they would not need to leave before us. Finally we get into the dealership and WOW it was like stepping back into the twilight zone. I assumed they were under renovations by how terrible the inside looked. The sales associate told me they had been in this location since 2018 exactly how it looked today. Absolutely ridiculous that a trillion dollar company can’t even afford a basic lounge area for its customers and employees. The poor employees. You can tell they get a lot of heat for the condition this place is in.

Tesla has provided the absolute worst level of customer experience I have ever had. They moved my delivery date multiple times which was fine when I was notified. Then before the final date they sent me a request for documents which I provided in time. When I showed up the next day to the delivery appointment, they told us the car wasn't ready and that it was the responsibility of the other department to notify me of delivery date changes. At this point I cancelled the order. On the way home the delivery manager called me on the way home to let me know that I was right and had provided what they needed but the person who was reviewing did not see this.

Tesla has the absolute worst customer service of any company I’ve ever bought a vehicle from out of the 15 cars I have ever purchased. They have absolutely surpassed the lowest of lows in my experience. I would never ever ever recommend buying a vehicle from them. Absolutely insane the treatment from this company for the price of the vehicles they sell. What a complete change in my opinion of them over 72 hours. Went from one of the most exciting and happiest purchases to a total regret in no time. I see why their customer service reviews are at 2.3 stars.

I bought my Tesla Plaid about six months ago, and after only 13k miles, I have had to replace all four tires costing me $2500.00. Tesla customer service claims this may be due to my driving style. Grand Prix, who actually put on the new tires, said the car was out of alignment hence why the tires went so quickly. Of course, Tesla customer service refuses to accept it. I have never hit a curb or drive aggressively to effect the alignment.

Tesla Insurance is the worst car insurance a person could have. I recently was involved in an accident and for the next TEN days, I was attempting to get a hold of my given adjuster, an insurance representative, or anyone through Tesla who could present me with a solution to getting a rental car. I am not joking when I say they were no help whatsoever. Every time I called Tesla’s insurance line at 844-348-3752, I got nowhere as it is just an automated line which gives suggestions. On that line I was told to email: (Rental@reply.teslainsuranceservices.com). As a result of emailing them a day after my accident, I still have not gotten a response and it has nearly been two weeks since I wrote it.

The Tesla Model 3, regular range gives me 430k of range per charge. I charge at home and we have not noticed the increase in hydro.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=8,"Dreadful experience buying a Tesla.From ordering a car to taking delivery from Tesla in the UK is a complete nightmare from start to finish.They aren't a conventional dealership like any you would recognise, think Amazon for cars. You don't get to deal with a human but an Algorithm. You can't speak to your local branch as they don't have a phone number and everything is routed through their Call Centre in Maidenhead. You can request to get a call from your local centre but I tried 8 times and never did anyone call back.After you pay your deposit you have 48 hours to complete the deal and pay the money.Tesla give you the Bank details of where to pay the money (in our case over £42K) The bank flashes up that this could be a fraudulent account and is not recognised proceed in the understanding you could lose your money. It is because Citi Bank isn't recognised in the UK.Trying to get basic info was horrendous. I spoke to the salesperson in the showroom and asked what the BHP of the car was, they said ""what's BHP""We tried to get the registration number for the car to sort out insurance but we were told the car will be registered only on the day of collection so entering the Reg No into websites doesn't work.Tesla seem to have a thing going with Directline insurance. You can't collect your car without insurance but they won't register the car with DVLA unless you provide Insurance. Catch 22. Directline insurance was £700 more expensive than my current insurer.Date of experience: May 29, 2023","{'date_of_review': '2023-05-29', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Dreadful experience buying a Tesla.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Algorithmic ordering process', 'Difficulty in getting basic information'], 'other_issues': ['Long wait times for customer service', 'Catch-22 situation with insurance and registration'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

Tesla makes a fantastic car, but they just don't support their product or customers. I've had my car (Model 3) for almost 3 years and have had to take it to the service center (2.8hrs away one way) three times. My most recent issue is the car is undrivable, tesla roadside was very quick to respond and arrange a pick up, but get no info on where it was going, how I would get around.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=11,"Imagine thisImagine this. You purchase a long range Model 3 Tesla for all the right reasons. Then, after two weeks, it is taken on its first reasonably long journey. Around 320km and back. The first day of school holidays is a breeze. A stop for coffee for 1.5 hours, all for the environment as the battery charges enough to get 3/4 of the way there. Then, a second stop 2/3 of the way there for half an hour, to pat a baby lamb and top up battery once again. We are only two hours behind and time is not money right? So what used to be a four hour journey is now six and with kids, would feel like nine. Fast forward to the journey home and we are nice and relaxed. We grab a coffee at the nearest town, knowing that there is an EV charge station, so having 90km left is not a problem. When we get to the charge station, we get a message on the Chargefox app that the station has faulted. We try a couple of times to charge, but to no avail. No worries, there are charge stations in every town along the way. The next station is 70km away and we have 90km left. Easy! We leave without a care in the world, until we use the demister to remove vapor from the front window and lose a couple of km. We are still ahead by a few km however things are starting to get tense as we arrive into the next town and head to the EV charge station 5km up. You can imagine our further frustration and concern, when the station is faulted aka not working. We call the local council and the ranger attends. We call Chargefox and they reset the station to no avail yet again. We all begin the head scratching as the problem has escalated into a minor emergency. Eventually, we are pointed toward a motel/lodge that has a wall charger. We plug in, jiggle a lot as the charger does not seem to connect, putting added stress on our environmentally friendly, time costly journey, but manage to dock. The news borders on good. The ""car"" is finally charging! Just 7 hours until it is fully charged. We decide to grab a coffee at the local cafe. Fortunately, we know somebody in this town or we would be stranded completely and they drive us to the cafe in one of those old fossil fuel cars, that work properly and can attend multiple stations that are not broken. Four hours later, we decide enough is enough. It is now dark, we are against nature, as kangaroos, emus and other animals begin their exploration. We have enough km to get home, so the delusion goes. Almost 300! Our destination is within reach. We head off, enjoying the sun setting over the hills, the silhouette of trees and distant pools of gold looking water. Maybe this is all meant to be, thinks the optimistic, pollyanna fool in me. Since right and wrong do not exist anymore, it is simply us, flawed biology against the perfection of manipulated numbers. Humanity is the issue. As we draw closer to home, I notice two or three km vanish from the screen into the cold night air. Who cares right? We are ahead of the curve. We even stop at a petrol station, stretch, talk to the owner about how they are getting screwed by the system and get some chips, aka fries. The go-cart is a joy to pilot and we are all smiles for a few more expensive km until we trip over a harsh reality. We are somehow in deficit and our destination is now out of range. What do we do? Have no fear, there are cobweb ridden, cable strewn, EV charge stations everywhere. We search up a couple a make a call to a Thai Restaurant, roughly 90km from home and the boss has Covid and is isolating, so we cannot access his cable. So we visit his restaurant, where there may or may not be a charge cable. The glass is half full, so we turn off the highway and head for some culinary delights possibly? Not possible, it's late, they are closing. However the big news is that they have a charge cable. Problems solved without trauma counselling. Excitedly, the restaurant employee wrestles with the combination lock of the charge box, while keeping an eye on customers and I reverse the ""car"" in gingerly, bordering on exhaustion, pretending to be moderately cognisant. Not long now, we are almost home. The lock box opened, the cable inserted and, wait for it, nothing. The box was green lit, writing cheques the car could not cash. No sale, no charge! Desperation grew. Can we try it again? We had 40km in the bank and our destination was still 90km away. Should we get a room? It is school holidays. Would the car be vandalized if we left it parked somewhere? Can we get a friend to drive 90km to pick us up? It was official, we were stressed. Could we sleep in the car at the restaurant? We began to search for accommodation, since it was late. Nothing! All booked out. But wait, we found another charge station. Such a progressive country we live in. You guessed it, it was faulted. We called Chargefox and got, ""sorry it is scheduled for repair soon.""

I was the happy owner of one of the first AWD P85D's purchased in December 2014. In October of last year, over half a year ago, I drove over a deep pothole in a rainstorm. The pothole caused the lower half of my rear bumper to become partially detached and water got into the battery housing area. It has now been over six months that I have not had my car as the repair shop continues to wait on brackets needed from Tesla to re-attach the assembly under the car. Tesla appears too focused perhaps on churning out new cars rather than on taking care of its existing customers.

Ordered car in Sept. In Jan I was curious if I could change color to another of the no extra charge ones. Since Customer Service is so slow I used my account online to. I expected maybe a change order processing fee or something similar to when you buy a new home. Pushed the Design Change button and BAM! Price was recalculated to current car price which is $5000 more. No ACCEPT/DECLINE option. Once you see the price it is too late. You are locked in. No UNDO button. Called Customer Service. Guy basically said ""Yeah, that sucks. You are screwed"".","{'date_of_review': '2022-01-08', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Ordered car in Sept.

I had issues with my Tesla Wall Charger and had previously called twice for assistance and neither one resolved my issue. I called a third time and spoke to Hannah. From the second she answered the phone I knew she was eager to help. She went through the notes that were written from my previous calls and told me we were going to get everything taken care of that evening. And guess what, she did. After being placed on hold for a brief minute, she came back with what I needed to do to take care of my problem. After a few minutes I received a confirmation e-mail that my replacement was being sent. It was such a pleasure to speak to someone that I could not only understand perfectly, but was knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with.","{'date_of_review': '2021-02-20', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': 'I had issues with my Tesla Wall Charger and had previously called twice for assistance and neither one resolved my issue.

This matter pertains to false advertising and a failure to uphold the promised capabilities of the vehicle. Despite Tesla's advertising and product descriptions promising a range of 330 miles on a full charge, my car has consistently achieved at least 40% less than this advertised range. This drastic shortfall has severely impacted the vehicle's usability and the value I derive from it. I scheduled a service appointment with Tesla. The resolution proposed by the service team was both shocking and unacceptable.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=7,"Tesla Legal ScamWarning - Tesla Legal Scam. Read this before you take Tesla to court. Tesla has two companies. One is called Tesla Motors, and the other is called Tesla Financial Services. If you purchase a car, it will come from Tesla Motors. When you have a problem with the vehicle, you will speak to the sales and customer support departments. If the dispute becomes legal, you will likely get transferred to the legal department, as I did. This is where the big scam begins.The legal department is a different company called Tesla Financial Services. They will engage with the complaint, and if you are still unhappy, they openly encourage you to take them to court. However, you are taking the wrong company to court! The judge threw out the case because I needed to take Tesla Motors to court instead of Tesla Financial Services!It's a very sneaky scam. Don't buy a Tesla. The car will go wrong, and then Tesla will do everything they can not to help you. Customer service is awful.Date of experience: January 17, 2024","{'date_of_review': '2024-01-17', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 'terrible', 'review_summary': 'Tesla Legal Scam.

Brad is trading out his Tesla for a new BMW EV. We had a mechanical problem with the Tesla and it took them over a year of LEGAL ARBITRATION to get it fixed. They ultimately swapped out the motherboard, which obviously could have happened months ago, but they kept saying, “Tesla isn’t a luxury car company like BMW.” Their customer service sucks and they’d rather arbitrate than repair. They probably racked up over $100k in attorney fees over the past year and didn’t reimburse us for ours.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=18,"Model S and Powerwall. A mixed bag, but I am a convert now!I bought a Tesla Model S two years ago.My Model S was great to drive and had more performance than I had ever had in a car. It was comfortable for long journeys across Europe and their supercharger network is a 'killer app' that enabled me to travel long distances with not too much planning.They are let down by poor quality - I had to get three significant paint blemishes fixed (free by Tesla) after delivery and the interior materials and quality are not a patch on luxury German cars.Sadly, they couldn't sort out a problem with the media chip on the car: Sometimes, after about a year, I had no media sound for hours, bluetooth wouldn't initialise and I had to learn to perform reboots on the whole system from time to time, sometimes while driving. I also lost confidence after the car's autopilot steered me suddenly into a kerb, damaging a wheel. I mentioned it to Tesla staff, but they didn't seem concerned.I decided to sell the car and asked Tesla for a trade-in price. Their offer was less than 50% of the sales price - so a huge depreciation. I sold it privately in a week for just under 70% of the purchase price. That suggests to me that Tesla are giving no support to the second hand market, but are prioritising massive profit from trade-ins.I loved the car despite its faults and am very likely to buy another one: There have been quite a few updates over the last two years and access to the Tesla supercharger network rules out any other electric cars for me at the moment.I do also have a Powerwall and that is performing way above my expectations after about a year in service. Customer service and information over the phone and email has been way better for me than email and phone service for the car, though the car service centre staff have always been really helpful and polite.Date of experience: August 21, 2020","{'date_of_review': '2020-08-21', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model S', 'customer_rating': 3, 'review_summary': 'A mixed bag, but I am a convert now!', 'technical_pros': ['Smooth ride', 'Great fuel efficiency'], 'other_pros': ['Comfortable for long journeys across Europe', ""Supercharger network is a 'killer app'""], 'technical_issues': ['Poor quality paint', ""Media chip problem: no media sound, Bluetooth wouldn't initialize, and reboots were necessary""], 'other_issues': ['Autopilot steered me into a kerb, damaging a wheel', 'Trade-in price was less than 50% of the sales price'], 'service_experience': 'average', 'overall_experience': 'mixed'}",True

After booking a back glass replacement a month in advance, I traveled two hours and booked a hotel, only to be told at 6 pm the night before that my car couldn’t be serviced the next morning. I was advised to reschedule in two weeks closer to my house, with no guarantee it wouldn’t happen again.While the staff was polite, there was no flexibility on a resolution beyond, “there’s nothing we can do” and “we didn’t make you book the hotel,” which is true. But the lack of alternatives—especially after spending significant money on prior services—was disappointing. For a company like Tesla, I expected more reliability and consideration for customer investment.I would love for Tesla to handle this service and all future services, but currently considering other options.

I've owned my Model Y for 3 years now. With the over-the-air software updates my car has gotten better with age adding new features and better safety for free. The driving experience is remarkable with the instant torque, quick acceleration, low center of gravity, great handling and one pedal driving. Autopilot has been amazing on those long road trips taking the stress out of staying in lane and managing speed especially during traffic jams. I love not having to carry around a set of keys with me as my phone locks and unlocks the car automatically.

Ordering my Model 3 was exciting, and I felt in control for most of the process. I felt the initial customer service person was excellent... very respectful and seemingly knowledgeable. Then a week before our agreed upon delivery date, I got a call from a pushy inventory guy in Portland (the car had to be shipped there first). He said they will deliver it the next day. This would have been great had it not been that I was out of town for another five days (they knew that). They wanted me to change my plans so they could get it off their lot was the reason I was told. It's a long story, but luckily my wife was able to be home from work to receive the car two days later.

I took my Tesla Model Y that I had just bought a few days ago for service center in Irvine to repair the rear seats' headrests which were rattling when they were in higher position. The rattling would stop where the headrests were all the way down to the lowest position.. After the mechanic confirmed the rattling noise he said that this cannot be fixed. I said in that case it is a design flaw. While I was discussing that issue, one of the service advisors told me that the person sitting in the back should rest his head on the headrest to prevent it from rattling. That comment was so ludicrous that I am still laughing at that comment.

After a recent tire rotation service for my Tesla Model 3, we took out the car for a test drive to a local store. While driving, we noticed that the right front wheel had flapping sound. After we managed to drive back home, I jacked up the car using my Jeep gears, and looked at the front wheel. Sure enough, the nuts on the front wheel bolts were all loose, and one of them was almost falling off of the bolt. Fortunately I got the toolkits to tighten the bolts, and the car came back to normal.","{'date_of_review': '2021-04-05', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model 3', 'customer_rating': 4, 'review_summary': 'After a recent tire rotation service, we noticed that the right front wheel had a flapping sound.

However, when we went to pick it up (drove 45 minutes), we waited over two hours before they told us that the car wasn’t there. We then had to wait five days before it arrived. We purchased an adapter to allow the car to charge faster. The sales person there insisted that it was the right one. However, it did not fit the receptacle and found out on the web that we needed a different one. We tried calling Tesla to find out how we could exchange the adapter, but it was nearly impossible to get through to someone. We finally got someone on the phone and two people assured us that if we take it back to the place where we picked up the car and purchased the adapter, they would reimburse us. So we drove another 45 minutes merely to find out that they would not refund us for the adapter. The sales person there recommended that we sell it on Ebay. So not only was it frustrating getting a hold of customer service, but we were also lied to. Our general experience is that after the sale of the car, Tesla no longer cares about its customers. It is nearly impossible to get an answer from them for any service. Employees are misinformed and not helpful.

I bought a Powerwall, but I can't set it to charge from the grid, unless their StormWatch system triggers it, and StormWatch is completely unreliable. It had turned itself on due to sprinkles in my area but won't turn on when there's a tornado watch. It took them over a year since I purchased the Powerwall for it to even be installed, and within just a couple of months, it broke down. It took another 3 months to get it repaired.

I was looking for an electric car in 2020 and Tesla was the only option. Unfortunately now I am stuck with the car and even though I like the car this is the worst service center I have ever known. Just to give you an idea- you have to go through their app which defaults to service at home (which I have never been able to use). After days waiting they let you know they can't come to your home and you need to schedule through their service center which are usually booked at least a month out. This all means you better not have an issue that needs instant resolution because you won't get it.

Tesla does a great job allowing you to fully test drive their vehicles and then purchase with a seamless easy experience. It took me 5 mins to order the car - a couple more to update insurance info and get financing sorted out. I’ll compare that to the normal 2 hours + at a dealership. Vehicle delivery took 10 mins. Car has been flawless. Done some longer trips and the software is amazing - you never run out of charge as the car will automatically add supercharger stops in on any trip.

“The measure of a company is not when things are going well but rather when there is an issue that needs solving.” Tesla has (and is) enjoying a good run. Perhaps that is why their poor customer experience has gone under the radar? Or perhaps since the dealerships have been eliminated there is not a “face” of the company that cares enough about the customer to resolve issues? Whatever the explanation Tesla's end game is “pay us more money so we can resolve your problem and get you back on the road”. That came directly from the Bellevue service manager. If you are the handful of Tesla owners that never have a problem then please move to the next review. If you are considering a Tesla we suggest moving on to Lexus or Audi. We have owned them both & both are outstanding cars & customer experiences.","{'date_of_review': '2023-03-08', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': '""The measure of a company is not when things are going well but rather when there is an issue that needs solving.""

I just wanted to share my experience with fast loss of range of my 2018 Tesla Model 3 Long Range. My Model 3 is now 3 years old and when I recently, April 2021, completely charged my Tesla I only got 270 miles of range. That is a loss of more than 40 miles in 3 years. I contacted customer service and was told that nothing is wrong with my battery and they tried to explain that the on board computer is not precise and underestimates range. I drove until my battery was almost completely empty and was able to drive exactly 270 miles as predicted by the Tesla computer. I usually never charge more than 90% and discharge below 50% during my regular daily commute. A loss of more than 40 miles in only 3 years is pretty disappointing. Need to think twice if I would buy an expensive Tesla again.","{'date_of_review': '2021-04-25', 'vehicle_model': '2018 Tesla Model 3 Long Range', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'Fast loss of range, disappointing experience.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Loss of more than 40 miles in 3 years'], 'other_issues': ['Disappointing experience', 'Need to think twice about buying again'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

Friday I purchased a new 2023 Tesla. Put down the deposit and received a purchase order number with the price breakdown. I was told I would get a PDF FORM with more specifics in about an hour to my email. Well now it is Monday and I never received anything. I was also told to log into the Tesla app to complete my purchase plans for pick-up of vehicle that was already in stock in Scottsdale AZ. I have sent emails, voice mails and text message to my Sales Advisor out of CA. Now his VM box is full and I haven't heard a word all day. I figured I would call the customer service line 888 and was holding for 1 hour and 16 minutes, while I worked and then decided to hand up. I will be cancelling this purchase and demanding my deposit back. The good news at least I figured out the service was horrible before taking possession of the Tesla car. Elon needs to call the phone line and follow up with his sales advisor to see how difficult it is to do business with them. My guess for every car sold they lose 2 sales.","{'date_of_review': 'Dec. 11, 2023', 'vehicle_model': '2023 Tesla', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Purchased a new 2023 Tesla but had issues with the sales process.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Never received PDF FORM with purchase details'], 'other_issues': ['Difficulty in getting in touch with Sales Advisor', 'Long wait times on customer service line'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

A year later, I sold my perfectly working GTI for a Tesla 3 AWD to get a NEW car, long story short the GTI had many engine issues and warranty was running out. Two weeks into this car, I can say the good news is the black piano is gone in the 2022 model. The bad, well, I got the T3 awd extended range version, and one thing people don't say openly is that this car doesn't do well in either cold or hot. Take the stated range and divide it by three in cold or hot weather. The EV future is a joke for now, and I can say that the plug-in hybrids make more sense with smaller batteries and less chance of a single cell failure. You only need one cell in that big 75kw package to reduce the performance of the whole battery. On the safety side, I suggest you check an EV fire, and you will see it is a chain reaction of cells overheating with flammable gases, an awful way to go.","{'date_of_review': '2022-06-28', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla 3 AWD', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'A year later, I sold my perfectly working GTI for a Tesla 3 AWD to get a NEW car, long story short the GTI had many engine issues and warranty was running out.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': ['The black piano is gone in the 2022 model'], 'technical_issues': [""doesn't do well in either cold or hot"", 'single cell failure can reduce performance of whole battery'], 'other_issues': ['EV future is a joke for now', 'plug-in hybrids make more sense with smaller batteries and less chance of single cell failure'], 'service_experience': 'average', 'overall_experience': 'poor'}",True

Updated on 08/08/2023: I complained over and over and got the ** that it was impossible to transfer to a new vehicle. Like an idiot, I bought a new Model S,  Then I was in shock to find out just days later after delivery that Tesla is offering a transfer of self-driving software now if you buy  Tesla this quarter. All the salesperson had to do is tell me to wait like five days. But they kept up the lie, no transferring. But the greedy Elon/Tesla still won't transfer mine. No appreciation for returning clients. I will never buy a Tesla Again. FYI the 405-mile range is more like 250. Also, the cars catch fire very easily. Advice, never ever pay the $15,000 for self-driving, if you get hit or car burns you're out the $15,000 for the software, even after only one day, and insurance companies do not cover the software. So very disappointed in Tesla and Elon.

When it comes to service Tesla is the worst. You have to schedule a service through the app. You never talk to a real person. You have to wait at least a month for a service date. This resulted in a complete failure of the suspension on our model S. There was not a place on the apps about suspension issues. If I could have talked to a real person to explain the issue I might have been able to get the car repaired before it was not drivable. You can pick your vehicle is not drivable but there are only a couple of options for this area and suspension is not one of them. We had to say our screen was bad to just get it towed to the service center.

My Tesla model 3 struck a small animal going 50 miles as it suddenly crossed the street causing a minor dent on the front fender and with that the park assist and front sensors got damaged. Made an appointment on the app and was scheduled within a week for someone to come do it where parked a day or a few days. Before the app I was requested for photos which I provided. I was then advised it cannot be done at home and need to bring the vehicle in to service center. The earliest convenient date for me was a month later. I brought in the vehicle. The facia was changed. Since I owned the vehicle for over 48 months and out of warranty no vehicle replacement or transportation was provided. The car was ready the end of the day and presumably the sensors were fixed, after about a 1700 dollar bill.

As I traveled on I-75 N towards Atlanta I hit a metal object on the road and busted the rim and tire. I safely pulled off the hwy into a gas station and requested road assistance from Tesla. They dispatch a towing truck but I had to wait two hours for the next available “authorized” towing service.

Delivery of my Model 3 was delayed by almost 3 months which caused me to miss the Federal tax incentive. The manager, Jaime **, offered a discount on the price of the car to make up for the missed tax incentive. I agreed to that since it seemed like a fair deal.

I often describe to acquaintances that switching from a traditional car to a Tesla vehicle is like when you switched from a ""flip phone"" to a smart phone. The smart phone and Tesla vehicle are paradigm shifts. The vehicle handles mundane tasks today like using your phone as a key/remote control, it knows when you are in the car and adjusts to you, it predicts what you are going to do and just does it for you. After driving a Tesla for a while you really notice all of the little mundane things a traditional car requires you to do. The car also updates over the web like a smart phone and new features continue to be added to it.

Amazing vehicle. Like having an iPad on wheels. Over-the-air updates keep it fresh. 0-60 acceleration is like a rollercoaster. Tesla service has been pretty amazing. Nothing compares to the supercharger network for long road trips. My next car is an EV but not just any EV, a Tesla EV. Don't knock it until you drive one. Yes, it's minimalistic on interior but I don't need a thousand doodad plastic bobs and buttons. Software is the future and the UI is clean, responsive and feels like using an Apple product. Great for everyday driving and can charge around 40-50 miles just on a regular plug at home, no need to install a special charger.","{'date_of_review': '2023-05-24', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': 'Amazing vehicle.

The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over the-the software updates.While using Autopilot it is your responsibility to stay alert, always keep your hands on the steering wheel and maintain control of your car. Further information regarding our Autopilot and full self-driving capabilities have always been available on our website and can be found here.Regarding your reference to the consumer law, please note because your purchase was a business-to-business transaction you are therefore exempt from consumer contracts and the 14-day consumer law does not apply to you. As previously advised, we are unable to process your refund request for Full Self-Driving, due to the feature being added to the vehicle specification at time of order. The feature is now locked to the specification of this vehicle and cannot be removed.We remain available to answer any further questions you may have and will continue to support you in the future.Kind regards,ElaneCustomer Service UK and Ireland""Date of experience: September 23, 2021","{'date_of_review': 'September 23, 2021', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model3', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'I was scammed by Tesla for £6800 worth of illegal software.

I've owned my Tesla Model S for 5 years. The battery is still charging completely, I get over the air updates, and it is fun to drive. It is good to know that the updates are like getting a new car with all of the latest features. The maintenance is low. I've just needed tire rotations. I had one rear lock recall which was paid for by Tesla. I had my rear camera give a fuzzy picture which was fixed by an over the air computer update.

I leased a 2019 Tesla 3 in 2019. I would have purchased it but was concerned about the quality of the car since this was a new model. Loved the car from day one. Drives great. I had a problem in 2020 or 9 mos. in when the driver seat would flatten out every time I got in and out of the car and on two occasions when I was driving the vehicle. Then I could not get into the service center. It was during Covid and I remained patient. It took 3 months to finally get into the service department in Costa Mesa which they fixed the problem. However, a new problem occurred. While my car was serviced my personal belongings we gone through and a bag with expensive equipment was taken from my car. Tesla Management would not comment or cooperate with requests for security data. I documented the theft with a complaint with Costa Mesa Police Department.

They say $35,000 for model 3 but out the door costed me close to $59,000. It isn't even about the price but it is more about what they give you for your money. They literally stripped the car of everything! Like almost $60,000 car and they don't even give you the $35 charger adapter. Mine came with beat up used charger and without an adapter.

I own a Tesla Model X and when it functions, it is a great vehicle. The issue is when something goes wrong. There is no easy way to contact their service department. The phone lines automatically ask us to handle anything via the app. And the app frequently closes tickets that aren't even resolved. I had paid for an extended warranty on my vehicle and it has been more than 7 weeks and it is yet to be applied to my account. I have spent hours of time trying to reach someone ""responsible"" who can provide me an update, ETA and/or resolution on when the warranty would be applied to my account. End result - zero progress.

Tesla, a company once celebrated for its groundbreaking innovations and customer-centric approach, appears to be shifting gears in a less favorable direction. It's disappointing to see Tesla now charging $205 to diagnose issues on cars that are still under warranty. This move seems to be a stark departure from their previous standards of customer service and may indicate a strategic pivot towards maximizing profits, likely under the pressure to appease shareholders.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=20,"Poorly made Car and poor Customer ServiceI was lured in by the thought of owning a self-driving/fully electric car and placed an order for a Model X. I also ordered a wall charger ahead of receiving the vehicle (wanted to have it installed before arrival). Loan was approved and trade-in/down payment were ready to go. However, earlier that day, my wife and I decided to visit the showroom to get a last look at the vehicle before going through with the purchase. Much to our surprise, the showroom model had noticeable design flaws! Pieces were sticking out, the front hood was too far to one side, amongst other things (this is the showroom model!). To top it off, while we were looking at the car, the service rep was on the phone with a customer and my wife overheard her saying, “We don’t want your friends making fun of you so we’ll take care of it.” We could no longer justify the price for the risk in receiving a poorly made vehicle (with a likelihood of needing repair after repair) and so we canceled the purchase that night. However, since I already placed the order for the wall charger, I needed to return it BUT Tesla refuses to process the return. They flat out ignored 3 requests for the return slip over the span of 2 weeks and I have a limited time to return the item (60 days); their website states they respond within 5 days. I followed their instructions exactly as listed on their website but still never heard back. All I can say at this point is I’m sooo glad we didn’t buy the car and we will certainly never even consider buying a Tesla again (even if they improve quality assurance). I can’t imagine dealing with the nightmare of spending over $100k on a poorly made car and dealing with such bad customer service. Good news is, these wall chargers sell on Amazon for about $1,000 (paid $500 for it) so shouldn’t be hard to recoup my losses. Just a heads up: Don’t buy the wall charger until after you pick up your car (that is if you’re brave enough to go through with the purchase).Date of experience: December 29, 2019","{'date_of_review': '2019-12-29', 'vehicle_model': 'Model X', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Poorly made Car and poor Customer Service', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['noticeable design flaws', 'pieces were sticking out', 'front hood was too far to one side'], 'other_issues': ['poor customer service', 'refused to process return'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True
tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=10,"Tesla: abysmal customer service, staff shortages and generally incompetent organisation.I ordered a Tesla Model Y Performance in March 2022, anticipating delivery by the end of the year. The car arrived a month early, in November 2022. And my excitement at embracing an EV was soon thwarted! I received a call from Tesla the night before delivery, asking me to confirm a few personal details to ensure their records were correct. Following the call, by my surprise I received an e-mail from ALD Finance (Tesla’s incumbent finance company) requesting me to sign a new finance agreement, despite having signed one two months prior! On the day of collection (24 November), I spent over an hour on the phone with a Tesla‘s finance team who stated numerous times that Tesla had made a mistake and that I should ignore the e-mail. I re-confirmed this with Tesla’s onsite finance team, they checked their records and confirmed everything was in order and that they had the signed finance agreement. On this basis they handed me the key/ card to the car. An elderly couple waiting with us to collect their car, were less fortunate. They had travelled several hundred kilometres to collect the car from Brent Cross Delivery Hub and despite being promised a walkthrough on how to operate the electric car, the Tesla employee simply said (quote): we don’t have any staff that can help you, from the very top of the organisation”. They were given the ultimatum of either collecting the car or rescheduling collection so they could bring someone with them who can operate the EV. I didn’t hang around to see how this played out as we had already waited an hour to collect our car and were in a rush to get back and collect our kids from school! Back to my Tesla fiasco. A few weeks after collecting the car, I received a call from Tesla’s finance team informing me that they had assigned the wrong car – yes, the wrong car – to my finance agreement and that I was indeed required to re-sign the new agreement, which meant an additional £200 a month! I offered to buy the car outright to which they agreed, subject to a re-quote as the car would be deemed as a used car (having been owned by Tesla in the few weeks that I had been driving it). A week later, now 23rd December, I received a call from Tesla informing me that in fact, I would NOT be allowed to buy the car as it had already been assigned to ALD. And it was not that the wrong car was assigned but in fact, it was a quote that I signed, not the Finance Agreement itself. Oh, and the onsite Tesla team released the car in error!The representative was obviously very confused and apologised at least 10 times, admitting Tesla takes full responsibility for the error (oh, the empathy!!) but then followed up with a ransom: either I re-sign the finance agreement with the new terms, or they would need the car to be returned on Christmas Eve as Tesla's entire finance team (I think that's 5 people in total) was to be shut down between Christmas and New Year. And so the marking of the end of my first and last, brief relationship with Tesla. Having purchased numerous cars in my time, Tesla is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to the quality of customer service, from their sales team to after-sales support and finance. Just give Tesla a call and you will see that their wait times are often 1-2 hours, literally any time of the day!How they justify their high price tag for what are very ordinary cars, amazes me! They have enjoyed thriving in a nascent market but the competition is catching up and Tesla will be back in the red…and all because Musk is adamant on bootstrapping multi-billion dollar companies…or circuses!Date of experience: December 24, 2022","{'date_of_review': '2022-12-24', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model Y Performance', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'abysmal customer service, staff shortages and generally incompetent organisation.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['wrong car assigned to finance agreement', 'car released in error'], 'other_issues': ['long wait times for customer support', 'poor communication'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

I first registered for a Model X in December 2020 at a Tesla dealership. I was told that the car would be available in February 2021. After that the communication went completely downhill. February came and went, zero communication. Some time later the date on my Tesla account was updated to August 21.... That came and went. It's almost December 2021 and we still don't have a car. No one at the dealership has a clue as to when the car will be available. The communication from Tesla has been minimal to none. Yes, Auto dealers across the US have had supply chain issues. But communication from other luxury car companies has been leaps and bounds better than Tesla. I hope Tesla management is getting this feedback. EVs are going to have some serious competition.... And based on Tesla's approach towards customer service (or lack thereof), I am now inclined to wait and purchase an EV from a competitor.","{'date_of_review': '2021-11-30', 'vehicle_model': 'Model X', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'Poor customer service experience with Tesla.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Supply chain issues'], 'other_issues': ['Minimal to no communication from Tesla', 'No clue about car availability'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

Just received my new Model 3. After driving it over a few weeks, found several problems. Unrelenting lower back pain that the Tesla people refuse to try to resolve except saying ""sorry."" The driver seat is extremely poorly made and not good for tall people. There have been a number of software glitches already. Worst of all is the customer service. All the people have treated me as if they are doing me a favor by even engaging with me. In my opinion, Tesla is extremely overrated. I will end up selling this car and taking the loss. If you think that you might be interested in a Tesla, do a huge amount of due diligence up front; the salespeople will be less than helpful. There's an overall attitude that their cars are so special that customer service is abhorrent.

After driving my new Model 3 for almost 5 years. the steering wheel cover is peeling. I took it to my local Tesla dealer for a solution and was told to ""use the App"". I was also told I will need to replace the steering wheel, which I can order on the App. I came home and went online, where I found nothing about replacing the steering wheel, but plenty of options for replacing the steering wheel cover. I went to the App and was quoted approx $1200 (CAN) for the service to replace the cover. As usual Tesla service personnel are completely unhelpful with what should be a simple fix. Any suggestions based on similar experience?","{'date_of_review': '2024-08-05', 'vehicle_model': 'Model 3', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'After driving my new Model 3 for almost 5 years. the steering wheel cover is peeling.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['steering wheel cover is peeling'], 'other_issues': ['unhelpful service personnel'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'poor'}",True

Tesla ignored my written complaint about it. They didn't even bother to erase the GPS info.

Despite that there was a real question as to whether the a/c failed before the 50,000 miles, they stuck us with nearly a $4,000.00 bill for it. Also they charged us an additional $750 for failed struts that they originally told us would be warrantied.

All the other reviews relate to Tesla cars and my review is for Tesla Energy. (Trustpilot wouldn’t set up a separate entry as they share a root web address.)I bought a Powerwall 2 and Gateway 2 in December. They have never worked as anticipated but just “sort of” worked. Then in June the Powerwall started being very sluggish in responding to the app. At the beginning of July it seemed to disconnect itself from the system. In a matter of minutes it went from 80% charge to 0%. It was difficult and time consuming to get any response from Tesla support. Then they didn’t believe that I hadn’t switched it off. They took 3 weeks to work out that it was broken. They have given me a replacement date 3 weeks hence, so by the time everything is working again I will have lost nearly 2 months’ use at the time of year when my solar panels are most productive.During my wait I have found that there are several competitors more suited to a smart grid.Date of experience: August 08, 2020","{'date_of_review': '2020-08-08', 'vehicle_model': 'Powerwall 2', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'I was a bit dubious about writing this review here.

The car is ok, unless you have to drive out of town. The service is more than extremely poor. No one ever knows what is going on, no one ever follows up, and no one ever calls you back. EVER. I had to drive my car from Charleston to Savannah (2.5 hours each way) for service. When I bought the car I was promised it would be picked up by them and brought back. That’s a blatant lie. As if that wasn’t enough, with a full charge, my model X claims that I can drive it 370 miles. I’m getting 245. Another lie.","2 validation errors for ReviewStruct

This vehicle is amazing. It drives beautifully. The take off is out of this world. I wish I would have gotten into this vehicle sooner. The technology inside the vehicle sets it apart from any other vehicle I have ever owned before. It is truly a work of art, not just by its design but by the technology and the easiness that brings to my drive. I had my doubts about fully electrical cars but owning this vehicle for over 3 years now, ha won me over and I doubt I will ever try a different brand. One of the things that sets it apart is that it was design from the ground up to be what it is.

Tesla preorder is scam to make some extra money tru nonrefundable deposit fees: they discriminate buyers based on their job title. They clearly said you don’t qualify and denies for Tesla loan based on the fact that I’m a for hire service driver and they don’t approve financing for Uber Lyft drivers.

What a horrible company. I did a 3 year lease on a Model X75. When I leased the car, I was told the car would be completely self driving in a year and I had to buy the software at $3400 now or my car wouldn’t have it. I paid the money and as of today, it’s still not fully self driving. At the end of my lease the sales agent was rude because I did not want to buy the car. When I turned the car in, the representative refused to do a walk thru of the vehicle. 2 months after I turned the car in, I get a bill for almost $1400. $400 to get the vehicle ready for sale and $1000 for 3 new tires. (I had to buy 1 new tire when I turned the car in due to a flat). I was 5000 miles under my allowed mileage and now they state the tires have excessive use and I have to pay for brand new tires. What a ripoff. I paid $1400 for 3 years and now they want to get me for more after the lease because I didn’t want to buy it?

Jared at Camarillo/Oxnard Tesla said I could get the car in plenty of time for my retirement. Then Tesla increased their prices and could care less about someone paying the lower price for the model Y. Now with the increase of gas prices I’m being pushed back even more. Tesla reps must be taking bribes! Others are getting their car faster if they pay more for their car. My account arrival date has changed numerous times and has gone from Jan 2022 to now August 2022.

I’m able to cool down the car down to around 60 when it’s 110 outside in a few minutes before getting in! The car accelerates at an amusing speed - 0-60 in around 3 seconds.

There was a Model 3 Performance available in Queensland that I wanted to purchase, but apparently, I couldn't because I live in Sydney. Can someone explain the logic behind this? I thought when a car is available, a customer should be able to buy it, and the company would make an extra effort to fix a situation that has caused the customer so much trouble. It was frustrating that I couldn't pick up the car with an NSW license or an unregistered vehicle license. These solutions should be possible if Tesla cares about customer satisfaction, but all I encountered was arrogance.To add to the frustration, I also didn't receive my $400 order fee refund. Believe me, if Tesla wasn't currently the best electric vehicle option, I'd be the first to switch. No empire lasts forever, and when that time comes, I won't hesitate to recommend to everyone I know to NOT buy a Tesla.

I purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance 2022 for $70,000 after taxes in June 2022. Unfortunately, Tesla recently reduced the price by approximately 15.7%, causing my purchase to result in a loss as my car is now worth less than the new prices. When I attempted to sell the vehicle, I received incredibly low offers ranging from $29,000 to $36,000, resulting in a loss of around 50% in just one year. This indicates that the car's value will be exceedingly low in the market in the coming years.

I was shocked to learn that Tesla doesn’t provide a loaner or Uber credit for cars out of warranty. Makes me want to reconsider whether I want to purchase another Tesla. I took my car in for a scheduled 9:00 appt yesterday for a blinker issue. I was told it was probably would be resolved by replacing a bulb. Called at 2:30 pm. The car just got in the rack for diagnostics. I can’t reach anyone for a status update. I am now wondering if out of warranty car owners don’t get the first rate attention that new owners get. It’s over 24 hours since I brought my car in and the service line wasn’t bogged down with Tesla owners waiting for service. My post to Consumer Affairs is not directed to an individual employee. It’s directed to what I believe is a new company rule.

Order a new Tesla model 3. I was very excited. Before ordering the Tesla I went through the trade in process. They gave me a estimated value according to my VIN. I was happy with the value so I went ahead and ordered and paid my 250.00 deposit. A day later I was told they could not accept my trade in due to it being a car that was registered in Canada before I owned it. You would figured seems how they had the VIN for the estimate they gave me they would have known that already apparently not. Without the trade in I was unable to secure the new car. At this point they refused to give the 250 back. Then on the phone they said, ""Don't worry you are not liable for the remaining 53k for the car."" ""You're Welcome."" Really!!! Well I now know even if I do move forward with an electric car in the future it will not be Tesla.","{'date_of_review': '2023-07-05', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla model 3', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Disappointing experience with trade-in process and deposit refund.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['VIN issue not caught during estimate'], 'other_issues': ['Trade-in process failed', 'Deposit not refunded'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=8,"FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AND A FAILURE TO UPHOLD THE PROMISED CAPABILITIES OF THE VEHICLEI am writing to file a formal complaint against Tesla, regarding a significant issue with my Tesla Model Y 2021, which I purchased inDecember last year. This matter pertains to false advertising and a failure to uphold the promised capabilities of the vehicle. DespiteTesla's advertising and product descriptions promising a range of 330 miles on a full charge, my car has consistently achieved at least40% less than this advertised range. This drastic shortfall has severely impacted the vehicle's usability and the value I derive from it. Ischeduled a service appointment with Tesla. The resolution proposed by the service team was both shocking and unacceptable. Theysuggested that to achieve the advertised range, I would need to disable the vehicle's cameras. This advice is not only impractical but alsonegates one of the key safety features of the car. There was no disclosure at the point of sale that the use of standard vehicle features,such as the cameras, would so drastically reduce the car's range. To suggest disabling a critical feature to achieve the advertisedperformance is misleading and diminishes the value and functionality of the vehicle. Feeling deceived by Tesla, as the product delivereddoes not meet the specifications and capabilities that were advertised, I am seeking a resolution to this matter. I propose the followingoptions: 1-A technical fix to the car that allows it to achieve the advertised 330-mile range without disabling any safety or standardfeatures. 2-Complimentary access to Tesla's Supercharger network 3-A full refund for the vehicle, allowing me to return the car.Date of experience: February 14, 2024","{'date_of_review': '2024-02-14', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model Y 2021', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': 'FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AND A FAILURE TO UPHOLD THE PROMISED CAPABILITIES OF THE VEHICLE', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': ['Scheduled a service appointment with Tesla'], 'technical_issues': ['Consistently achieved at least 40% less than the advertised range', 'Suggested disabling cameras to achieve advertised range'], 'other_issues': ['Feeling deceived by Tesla', 'Product delivered does not meet specifications and capabilities that were advertised'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

There is essentially no way to talk to a person when you have an issue with your Tesla. Mine is 18 months old, and if I have an issue (like a warning message that affects the power train), my only option is to schedule service. At that point, you get sparse text messages that are days apart and don't answer your questions. If you live hours away from a service center (since there's so few of them), you'll just have to risk taking off a day from work and hope that they fully understand the issue and have the parts.","{'date_of_review': '2020-02-26', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 3, 'review_summary': 'There is essentially no way to talk to a person when you have an issue with your Tesla.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Warning message that affects the power train'], 'other_issues': ['Sparse text messages', 'Days apart', ""Don't answer questions""], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

We bought a Model X 2020 brand new. We noticed rattling when driving a few months later and took the car to Tesla dealership. They blew us off and said there was nothing wrong. The problem got worse and we then noticed the car pulling badly to the right. I had to use both hands on the wheel to center the car on the road. Checked the tire pressure and all ok. Tried to make an appointment to take the car in and they wouldn’t accept it until they did their own diagnostics over the air. You can’t talk to a human on the phone. Only text through Tesla app. It took 4 weeks to finally getting an appointment and we stopped driving the car since it felt incredibly unsafe with excessive rattling and pulling to the right. Basically had the car in the garage for 4 weeks waiting for an appointment. Tesla dealer is an hour and a half from our house and to get there you have to get on I-4 which is a crazy dangerous Interstate very busy and a ton of construction.

Tesla decided they didn't like that I had a different state license than where I am moving to. They told me I would only be allowed to purchase the vehicle if I wait the 3 months to get a new license in that state due to Covid. On top of that they feel their policies overpower the states laws. The state I was registering in is a self registration state and this should NOT affect the actual purchase of the car as the bank owns the title not Tesla. On top of that if I had a co-signer they would have to have the same license as myself which is literally impossible as it was my sister who now lives in a different state. They then proceeded to say I would evade taxes which makes absolutely no sense. I didn't even talk to them about taxes. I AM APPALLED.

I returned my 3 Year Lease with 21,000 miles. They said they would work with me.... But the tire tread was too worn. Their tires are not cheap. You can buy tires for almost 1/2 the price they are charging with the return. We have a Tesla now, it's our 3rd. If you ask me if I will lease or buy a Tesla the answer is NO WAY!

I currently have a 2021 model Y. Vehicle was great, but as soon as I passed the 50,000 miles threshold (only by 3K) the whole vehicle started failing, due cold weather, the heating pump and multiple sensors failed including the auxiliary 24V battery. Be advised that each repair cost around $4800. Just diagnostics by ti self are close to $1000, plus towing the vehicle is another $460.

Tesla insurance ignored me for several months. It has taken 6 months for my adjuster to set an appointment for repairs after several emails phone calls and escalation to management. Finally, I had my friend who works at Tesla reach out internally. I have had an extremely difficult time reaching customer service in a reasonable time frame for general issues. The app does work well for some needs but overall it has been a nightmare getting in contact for different issues. The only time I was able to reach an agent promptly was when they needed me to move forward with purchase and delivery. Unfortunately, I have lost all trust in this company through these experiences. They must be terribly overworked and understaffed.","{'date_of_review': '2023-01-21', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Tesla insurance ignored me for several months.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Difficulty reaching customer service'], 'other_issues': ['Terrible experience with adjuster', 'Lost trust in the company'], 'service_experience': 'terrible', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

Because Tesla is far from just a company that makes cars, it literally disrupted the whole auto industry and shaping its future right now.I had the chance to drive around a few of their models, The Tesla Model 3 for example, and it was futuristic, it was simple, it was straightforward, it is so good! Apart from the tech, if we get to the actual car part, the acceleration is quite instant and smooth, you feel the power under your feet when you hit the gas pedal. Autopilot feature is also really something. the whole design of the car is quite sleek. I am not big fan of giant touchscreens, i am more of a button person but that's maybe because there are still so many cars available with buttons, but im sure it will be the game in town in a few years. They are on point. I know what youre thinking, charging infrastructure in so many countries are not on high levels. But they are getting there, no worries. It 's clean driving that will be in the forefront of everything in the future, so, be ready for the fundamental changes in this industry.Now what we see when we actualy look at a Tesla, it is just an ordinary electric vehicle on wheels.

The fit, finish, and build quality on my 2012 Chevrolet Volt was much better. Tesla service is TERRIBLE. I have a flat. No spare tire. They are closed for three days for Memorial Day and in OKC they don't loan tires. Most tire shops are not equipped to handle Tesla tires. The roof is glass. Your head will cook on a bright sunshiny day. The car has had a rattle since day one. The touch screen is a total nuisance. It is great fun to drive but if you can't drive it ... well. They have roadside service but that just hauls your car to the service center. Everything is done by texting. They do not repair a tire on the road.","2 validation errors for ReviewStruct

I have a concern with my Tesla service. In February of this year, I brought my car in for a squeak emanating from the driver front wheel when the suspension articulates. I booked a service and the service team found there to be an issue with the upper control arms and they were replaced on the left and right on the front. Recently, when I summoned the vehicle, I found the front inner tires to be bald in the inside and have depth remaining on the outside. I booked another service and brought the vehicle in on Saturday, August 13th, 2022. The service advisor and a service tech told me that the tires worn normally, and the inner edge wore due to “the cars normal turning,” but also, “the car was not aligned on a normal basis.” The inner edge of the tire on both the front wheels is bald on the inside, and has thread left on the outer edge. I have pictures of this.

The car makes sure that you are safe when driving using myriads of safety features, including the built-in dash cams. So far I have seen a fluctuating range loss (~4 miles) based on 6000 miles of driving. The one thing that is EXTREMELY ANNOYING is the paint job.

Absolute worst car I’ve ever owned in my life from delivery to eight months later. Had to take it into the Burbank service center to get the windshield replaced because it got hit by a rock and split. After I got it back, the range decreased significantly the radio stopped working and it wasn’t calibrated correctly. I’ve had more issues with this car than I’ve ever had with any car I’ve ever ever owned and I am 58 years old so I’ve had quite a few of them. Knowing at this company is held accountable. All they do is send some kid out with pimples on his face to tell try to convince you that there’s nothing wrong with the range of your car. Then when you argue the point they try to make up things like well.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=1,"Troubles with Tesla headlight replacementI am trying to replace a headlight on my Tesla model S and am having very difficult time with services. I started this process in July and I got an appointment for August. One week before the appointment I got an estimate for $770. I had to  cancel that appointment  and when I went to reschedule I was directed to another service center. A month later they provided an estimate for the same job for $2200. So super high for a bulb/headlight setup replacement. I cancelled that appointment dud to price but now I cannot get any appointments at the “cheap” $770 location. On line I am reading that someone was given a $3600 estimate for a headlight replacement. Why is there such a range of pricing for a necessary repair provided by Certified Tesla service centers? 770 - $3600 is a 500% difference. Why is Tesla not allowing contact with all service centers but is limiting  owners by their algorithms which dictate where can one go for a service? I have to drive and charge 2 times on a way to get a bulb replacement  and  I don’t have a choice to call  a service center directly or choose to which service center to go. Rather, I depend  on Tesla algorithm with restrictions and limitations. Being a Tesla owner is very frustrating when one needs service. I must say thus far the service that we have had was fairly priced, this is the first item the tag seems outrageous. Last year our entire Tesla computer system was changed and we paid $2200 - is the headlight with a burned bulb an equivalent value or work to Tesla computer system? How many Tesla owners are willing and able to pay 2-3 K for a headlight replacement where a bulb replacement would do.  Many of us are driving Tesla not as an income statement but because we want to protect the earth for children and their children. It would be great if Tesla would provide access to their service centers and pricing on line and if they would make sure that there is no 500% price difference for the same job among Tesla Service centers to which they direct us.

We should have had an inkling when we picked up our car in Kansas City and it was not sufficiently charged for us to get home to Nebraska. The ride was rough and the operation was not instinctive. Since this was a tech company which sells cars, there was no drivers manual, and everything had to be accessed by phone or computer. We were surprised that there were no floor liners, but learned that they are available for $400. How do we sync our garage opener with the car? That would cost $300. The key is the dimension of a credit card. My wife lost hers in the shuffle. The new one cost $40. Tesla is the Spirit Airlines of car companies. The Model Y is advertised as getting 330 miles on a full charge. According to our figures, we are getting 230 miles.

Ordered a model Y and was told it would take 3 weeks. Waited for 4 weeks after not hearing a word from Tesla and not being able to get ahold of anyone. Finally I got someone on the phone at the dealership in Vancouver and they said my car wouldn't be ready for at least ANOTHER 5-9 weeks because they are not going to build it until everything is sent to Europe first.

Drop in Tesla Model S battery mileage capacity from 260 to 200 after field service. At this point I am a hugely concerned customer. It has already resulted in 8 calls and repeats of issue replanation on every call AND absolutely no correction. After my tesla service at Eatonville FL on Feb 17 and 18 of May 2022, my tesla is showing maximum battery capacity of only 200 miles. And I am noticing very slow charging speed at around only 130 miles. Before 17th ie before taking for servicing I have always charged the car at an avg of 230 miles+. At some times I have charged even 250 miles. However now I can max charge only 200 miles and frankly it gets extremely slow at 160 miles that I actually cannot charge anymore.

We own a Tesla Model 3 2022 for about 9 months now. The car itself is good so far. The problem is on customer support. My wife got a flat tire today at 7pm at night, and she called me. At first I told her to call AAA. But then I googled, to my surprise, Tesla cars do not have spare tires. The roadside support page sent us to ""roadside assistance"" option on the app. The app responded ""help is on the way"", but we sat and waited for 50 minutes before they responded with a text. (There was no sign on the app that our request for assistance progressed anywhere, or if anyone is tending the request at all, during that entire 50 minutes. We got impatient and looked for a phone number to call, but there was not any live person to help anywhere!).

I took delivery on a Model 3 yesterday. It was a far from pleasant experience. 1st, I was told that orientation could not be scheduled immediately prior to delivery. So I drove 3 hrs from home to show up for orientation 3hrs before delivery. Orientation started 1/2 hour late. After twiddling my fingers for 2 1/2 hours, I presented for delivery only to be asked if I was ready for orientation. 2nd. Living 3 hrs from the Tesla center, I requested that my car be fully charged at delivery. It wasn’t. Less than 1/2. 3rd. The Bill of Sale had incorrect amount due.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=8,"Dear Tesla Customer Service,Dear Tesla Customer Service,I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the customer service and delivery process for my new Tesla Model S Plaid.When I placed my order, I was informed that the delivery would take approximately two weeks. However, it took an astonishing two months, with the scheduled delivery date being June 30th.On the day of the scheduled delivery, I received a call just one hour before my pick-up time, notifying me that my vehicle had not arrived at the designated location. I was told that the car was stuck three hours north of the pickup point and was reassured it would be delivered to my home by 7 PM that evening.I spent the entire day eagerly waiting at home, excited to receive my new vehicle. By 8 PM, it became clear that the car was not going to arrive. I attempted to contact the number that had reached out to me earlier, but received no response.The following day, I tried to respond to the text message, as advised, but again received no reply. I also attempted to reach out through the Tesla app and called the delivery location multiple times, navigating through the phone menu options to no avail. The lack of communication was highly unprofessional and deeply frustrating.To my dismay, I later noticed an update in the Tesla app, rescheduling my delivery to July 5th. Unfortunately, I will be traveling for the holiday and cannot make this appointment. Despite my attempts to communicate this issue via text, the Tesla app, and multiple phone calls, I have received no response.I am extremely dissatisfied with this entire experience, especially considering the significant investment in a vehicle that costs over $100,000. The lack of communication and the repeated delays are unacceptable and have left me deeply disappointed.I request immediate attention to this matter and a resolution that ensures prompt and reliable delivery of my vehicle. I also expect an explanation for the poor service and what measures Tesla will take to prevent such issues in the future.Date of experience: June 30, 2024","{'date_of_review': '2024-06-30', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model S Plaid', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': 'Extreme disappointment and frustration with the customer service and delivery process.', 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Car stuck three hours north of the pickup point'], 'other_issues': ['Lack of communication', 'Repeated delays'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

I have owned a Tesla for 4 years so I have a lot of experience with the service centers. First, you are unlikely to have one near where you live. For me the closest is 30 miles away and it used to be even farther. Second, you can ONLY schedule and communicate with them via texting within the Tesla app. This makes communication cryptic and challenging at best. Reps almost never identify themselves by name so no accountability. They typically only give morning appointments and tell you it will be ready at or near closing time. They only provide loaners when the work is under warranty but even then only based in availability. They do offer “mobile service” which comes to your home.

First let me say I do not enjoy writing negative reviews as I too am a business owner but people should know about this. I do apologize about the length of this review. I had a delivery date of a MY on Feb 6th-one day prior I got a text saying the car would not be there then and moved the date till Feb 13th…OK there could have been logistics issues since it was a Fremont build…I get it. On the 13th I go to the Tysons Location to get the car. I was told once I went in the red door around the side, ""Go inspect your car and if you like it accept it and drive away."" I did inspect it and everything seemed fine except I noticed some issues with the paint that appeared to be under the clear coat.

IT IS A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE!Review:IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY!                       IT IS A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE!Tesla's Fort Lauderdale retail/service location ignored our presence at their show room this past Monday.There were 4 Sales Advisors behind a desk to the left of the glass door to the showroom.All four were busy looking at pc and or iPad screens, and none of them acknowledged our presence for about 5 to 7 minutes of us standing about eight feet from them.Then, one whose name we will not motion here, who in the end was polite, asked what he could do for us.We explained that when we got delivery of our second Model S we were not given the second key-fob standardly provided on delivery at that time to any Model S new owner.We explained that we had called Customer service and that a representative said that a note would be placed on our account allowing the service to provide the free key-fob. As he could not find the note, he said that he would text that person internally to confirm.Upon leaving the dealership, as asked by that Sales Advisor, we called Customer Service back and spoke with a person who happened to have the same name as the one we had spoken to that morning. She saw no notes on the account but assured us she would not only type them in but contact via text that Advisor we had just spoken with.Well, last night I received a message, from that Advisor, in which he said they would not do that “because he could not see any authorization on that and that his Management did not want to provide the replacement key fob for free as the “too much time had passed since we purchased the Model S”.Principal:We have been a long-time loyal Tesla owner since 2016, with the plans to exchange our owned Model S for a Plaid Model in the first QT of 2023. The extremely poor and unthought-out decision by the Fort Lauderdale Manager, as we were told, is so unfortunate!It is not business oriented at all that a Tesla Dealership Manager would not provide his customer with a free key fob which at cost for Tesla would represent less than 0.04% of the price of the car we intend to buy!Well, the price that they would charge of $217.75 is not the question here, but what does matters is the fact is that we were not provided with the second fob at delivery of our brand-new Tesla Model S at that time, therefore we should not be incurring in this expense at all. It is a question of principle, not money!For a long time, we have been noticing that Tesla is declining their customer service as originally experienced by us in 2016. It was awesome until we believe 2018!Since them we waited at times almost one hour on the phone to get a representative over the phone, and we were treated with disrespect at least two times at the North Lauderdale Service/Retail branch.At a time in which serious competition, not too much for the model S, is knocking on Tesla’s doors day by day louder and louder it does become crucially important that Tesla pays attention and moves their service to one of the utmost Excellence.We would like the Management at Fort Lauderdale to be aware of what they are doing in terms of customer service, both on the retail and on the service side. On our last visit the speakers were blasting with rock music, so loud that the service representative behind the counter needed to scream at him so that we could understand him and vice versa.The service center looked disorganized and very confusing! On top of that we were ignored also by one of the persons on the second roll of counters, which was a female. She never acknowledged our presence as well. This is unacceptable!We would like to get this situation resolved and obtain the key fob which was never provided to us at delivery by the Dania Beach location (they were awesome to us on any encounter). Too bad that they are now closed!Date of experience: October 24, 2022","{'date_of_review': '2022-10-24', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla Model S', 'customer_rating': 1, 'review_summary': ""Poor customer service at Tesla's Fort Lauderdale retail/service location."", 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Key fob not provided at delivery'], 'other_issues': ['Long wait times on phone', 'Disrespectful treatment by service representatives', 'Loud music in the service center'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

I have never seen so many amazing technology in a car. Not to mention the periodic OTA (Over The Air) software update that improve the car even more. OTA make it feel like having a new model of the car every so often. Like many people told me, once you drive a Tesla, you can never go back to any non-Tesla cars! The Tesla charging network is also amazing! Instead of stopping at a gas station and go to the tiny mini-mart and dirty bathroom, their charging station almost always at some nice location with good restaurant or mall. Plug it in and have a nice lunch or quick bathroom break. It's part of the nice road trip experience. Oh, almost forgot their auto-pilot. I used to hate driving in traffic or long drive. Now, I just let the car drive when I'm bored from long drive or stuck in traffic. No matter where I am, I can rely on the auto-pilot to drive for me! The review is getting too long. Just so many good things with Tesla.","{'date_of_review': '2023-05-24', 'vehicle_model': 'Tesla', 'customer_rating': 5, 'review_summary': 'I have never seen so many amazing technology in a car.

tesla,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/tesla.com?page=8,"Don't Buy Tesla Solar Panels Unitl They Resolve This Known IssueI bought Tesla solar for my house after a great experience buying a Tesla vehicle, and because I was shopping for solar panels anyway. The purchase was made in late 2023 and the install happened around March. Finally, in April everything went live.I noticed immediately that the wiring seemed off and certain appliances started to trip on the breaker panel. Our fridge would suddenly be turned off, and we'd notice it was due to the breaker Tesla installed. We replaced the breaker at our own expense.Next, we noticed the Tesla app stating the house was using 0 kw for the entire house anytime the air conditioning came on. This obviously makes no sense and it couldn't be true. This resulted in our system reporting more electricity being sold back to the grid than we were actually selling back. I contacted Tesla about this and they claimed that my system was running fine on their end, and they showed no errors in my configuration. I kept telling them they needed to send someone out but they initially refused, unless I paid $300 service call fee. At some point about week later, Tesla then emailed me saying my system shows signs of errors and they need to send someone out. Someone first came out in early June. They claimed the system was running fine, but that I needed a new unit that housed the fan (but that the fan couldn't be replaced alone, they'd have to replace the entire unit--I forgot the name he called it). During that visit, I showed the Tesla technician the app and what it reported when the AC came on. He claimed it was an app issue and if I logged out and deleted the app and reinstalled it, it would be fixed. I did this and it didn't work. He scheduled another technician to come out in late June to replace the unit. When this technician came, he claimed there was an issue with the Tesla system and that he addressed it. He told me that he would call me the next day to check that it was fixed and he did not. The issues remained.By now, I'm getting bills from my electricity company (TEP) with major discrepancies compared to what the Tesla app shows that I'm selling back to the grid and using etc. I then received a very high electricity bill for $274, the same amounts I would receive in the summer here in Arizona if I had no solar panels. At this I was infuriated because I'm paying a similar amount for the solar panels and my expectation was that it would drastically reduce my bills (this being the 3rd month being live).I then went back on the Tesla app and chatted with service for help. I told them the entire story. I asked Tesla to reimburse me for the months that I've been paying for solar panels without them working properly. I explained the new issues to Tesla. 1. The fridge in my house is still randomly tripping off on the panel (this started happening after the solar installation)2. The app still shows that the home is using 0 kW at times when that is clearly not the case. It usually does this when the Air Conditioner comes on. 3. At night, the system is falsely showing that it receives energy from the sun. It is charging my Tesla vehicle and it should only be charging on solar (above 45%). It charges at night somehow because the system falsely says it is receiving solar energy in the middle of the night.4. At times it shows the home is using 7.7 kW while no major appliances are on (i.e. the AC, which usually is responsible for driving up the power usage). Then when the AC comes on the kW being used actually drops significantly to 1.2 kW. Tesla told me that I need a Whole Home Cycle, or reboot for the system. The process was emailed to me and I was told to wait 24 hours to see if the problems persisted. The problems persisted. I then asked Tesla again to  send someone out and rewire the system, and investigate this properly. I asked also for a refund of months paid, because in essence they've sold me a defective product. Tesla refused, saying they don't reimburse in such instances. I told them they need to either fix the problem, or take the panels off and cancel the purchse and provide a refund. They now have said they're sending more technicians over on 7/24/24 to invetigate the issue. Meanwhile, the system is still faulty. I have no idea of how much energy I'm actually using and what's being sold back to the grid. The system says I'm generating solar in the middle of the night without the sun. This is what I would expect from a very amateur and scammish company, not Tesla. Highly disappointed in the service and the product's functionality. I hope Tesla responds here and gets this addressed. Otherwise, I hope this thread warns and stops people from buying Tesla solar until they fix this very known issue.Date of experience: June 02, 2024","{'date_of_review': '2023-12-31', 'vehicle_model': '', 'customer_rating': 2, 'review_summary': ""Don't Buy Tesla Solar Panels Unitl They Resolve This Known Issue"", 'technical_pros': [], 'other_pros': [], 'technical_issues': ['Wiring seemed off', 'Certain appliances started to trip on the breaker panel', 'System falsely showing that it receives energy from the sun at night'], 'other_issues': ['Fridge would suddenly be turned off', 'Tesla app stating the house was using 0 kw for the entire house anytime the air conditioning came on'], 'service_experience': 'poor', 'overall_experience': 'terrible'}",True

Love my Model Y but my experience with their customer service/dealer service leads me to not recommending anyone to purchase from Tesla. Would give them zero star if I could. When I picked up SUV, it was filthy on the outside. I made them wipe down the entire SUV before I took ownership. Inside was not prepped either.
